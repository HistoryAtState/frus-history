            <p style="font-size: 0.825em; text-transform: uppercase;"> A panel discussion at the
                Wilson Center<br/>December 8, 2011, 4-5:30 p.m.</p>
            <p>While the formal classification system used to keep sensitive government information
                secret was a 20th Century development, even in the 19th Century, new research shows,
                the Department of State had to balance the “public’s right to know” with protecting
                national interests. Foreign policy documents were often released soon after events
                took place, sometimes complicating diplomatic relations. In certain instances
                sensitive documents and information were withheld, usually in the name of national
                security, but occasionally for political advantage. Congress, the media, public
                audiences, and other governments all took an interest in this peculiarly American
                penchant for walking the tightrope between transparency of governmental operations
                and withholding information "not in the public interest."</p>
            <p>“Diplomatic Secrecy in the 19th Century” will explore the earliest available examples
                of both America's open and secret diplomacy, as well as how the ad-hoc system used
                in the 19th Century formed the basis for the formalized system which was developed
                in later years.</p>
            <p>Panel participants: Aaron Marrs, Peter Cozzens, and William B. McAllister.</p>
