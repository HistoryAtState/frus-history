            <p style="font-size: 0.825em; text-transform: uppercase;"> A discussion at the Miller
                Center of Public Affairs<br/>University of Virginia<br/>November 7, 2011, 4 p.m.</p>
            <p>Since 1861, the <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em> (or <em>FRUS</em>)
                series has evolved to become the official documentary history of U.S. foreign
                policy, produced according to scholarly best practices and under a Congressional
                mandate. As part of the sesquicentennial anniversary of the series, the Office of
                the Historian at the U.S. Department of State launched a special research initiative
                to explore the history of <em>FRUS</em>. On November 7, come to the Miller Center to
                participate in a discussion with Office of the Historian staff members William
                McAllister and Joshua Botts as they share research into how the U.S. Government has
                historically struggled to balance security imperatives with its commitment to
                transparency and democratic accountability with University of Virginia faculty and
                students and the interested public.</p>
