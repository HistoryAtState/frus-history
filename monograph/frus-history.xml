                <quote rend="blockquote">“The Government continually depends upon the support of
                    Congress and the People, and that support can be expected only in the condition
                    of keeping them thoroughly and truthfully informed of the manner in which the
                    powers derived from them are executed.”—William H. Seward to Charles F. Adams,

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> (<hi
                        rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) series, the official documentary record of U.S.
                    foreign policy, was born in the opening months of the Civil War. Originating in
                    a response by the Department of State to a request from Congress, the series has
                    endured through vast changes in the international system and the United States’s
                    role in the world, through equally vast changes in the Department of State and
                    in the nation’s government, and through recurrent crises that at times
                    threatened the very survival of the series. The series’s longevity testifies to
                    the power of the ideal it represents and upholds—of the need for transparency
                    and accountability in a democratic system.</p>
                <p>As the sesquicentennial of its foundation neared, it became clear that much of
                    the series’s history had vanished over time. The Historian at the time,
                    Ambassador Ed Brynn, directed the Special Projects division, under Dr. William
                    McAllister, to resurrect that history—both to honor those who have built and
                    executed the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, and to capture the
                    lessons available from a study of the past, as managers and historians have
                    struggled to address the issues that have recurred throughout the 150 years of
                    the series.</p>
                <p>Dr. McAllister assembled a team from within the office, each member a specialist
                    in their own right, to pull together the complex history of the series. Dr.
                    Aaron W. Marrs had already begun an investigation into the 19th-century origins
                    of the series, and extended that work for inclusion in this volume. Peter
                    Cozzens, a nationally-recognized historian of the Civil War and the postbellum
                    era, addressed the development of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series from 1865 to 1895. Dr. Joshua Botts picked up the story in the 1920s,
                    covering the succession of dramas that have led to the current series. In
                    addition to coordinating and editing the overall effort, Dr. McAllister took
                    upon himself the responsibility to research the pre-1861 precedents of the
                    series and to explain the critical transformation in the series’s mission that
                    unfolded between the Spanish-American War and the 1920s. Together they have
                    created a comprehensive narrative with as much to say about the evolution of the
                    nation as about the evolution of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series.</p>
                <p>No one expected to find the sort of dramatic story that Dr. McAllister and his
                    team have unveiled. As with any good research project, this trail led into
                    unanticipated complexities and yielded unexpected benefits. The resulting
                    history has demonstrated the world-class research skills of the members of the
                    Office of the Historian. Moreover, like the series itself, this history has
                    depended on support from other offices of the Department of State and from
                    agencies across the government for its success.</p>
                <p>Neither did anyone expect the extraordinary value of the ongoing research for the
                    volume in shaping and informing the decisions of the current leaders of the
                    Office of the Historian. Again and again, as we have faced issues ranging from
                    the realm of declassification, to questions of managing the surpassingly
                    complicated processes needed to produce the series, to decisions on technology,
                    we have called upon the experience of the past to inform the future.</p>
                <p>Today the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> stands as
                    the global gold standard in official documentary history. It is the
                    longest-running public diplomacy program in U.S. history, and the largest and
                    most productive documentary history program in the world. This outcome was never
                    foreordained. It rests upon the perseverance and vision of generations of
                    historians, from the anonymous Clerks of the 19th century, through the first
                    generation of professional historians entering the Department during the
                    interwar years, to those of the present day—compilers, reviewers,
                    declassification coordinators, and editors—working to uphold the promise of the
                    1991 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute. All have contributed to the continuing
                    quest to provide a “thorough, accurate, and reliable” official record of U.S.
                    foreign relations. This volume is dedicated to the men and women, past and
                    present, who have created this unique and invaluable contribution to U.S.
                    democracy.</p>

                        />Questions have been raised about the integrity of our own historical
                        record at the very time that in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and
                        elsewhere we are witnessing a flood of disclosures and new documentation
                        from governments long used to concealing and falsifying the record . . .
                        this is no time for the United States to depart from the tradition of
                        providing an accurate and complete historical record of the actions taken by
                        our government in the field of foreign relations.—Senator Claiborne Pell,

                <p>In 1990, longstanding tensions over U.S. Government transparency policy came to a
                    head. For the preceding 200 years, the executive branch routinely released
                    official diplomatic documents to the congress and the public. Since 1861, the
                    Department of State’s <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</hi> (<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) series served as the leading
                    instrument of this tradition. While the Department published <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi> volumes nearly contemporaneously with the events they documented
                    in the 19th century, the timeliness of the series receded over the course of the
                    20th century. Since the 1930s, volumes appeared decades after the events that
                    they documented.</p>
                <p>International and bureaucratic dynamics contributed to this shift in U.S.
                    Government transparency. The increasing tardiness of the series coincided with
                    the growth of complex bureaucracies to manage U.S. foreign policy and to
                    maintain, review, and release government records. The Department of State’s
                    influence over foreign affairs—and its control over publishing records relating
                    to foreign policy—diminished as more government agencies assumed international
                    responsibilities. Additionally, as U.S. engagement in global affairs expanded
                    and grew more multilateral, policymakers rebalanced the value of openness in
                    light of the imperative to maintain good relations with other governments.</p>
                <p>By the 1980s, those trends brought the U.S. Government’s commitment to openness
                    into question. Guardians of security, representing longstanding concerns that
                    publishing foreign policy documents endangered vital national interests,
                    prevented the release of important records, which jeopardized the credibility of
                    the series. Transparency advocates, who championed equally venerable traditions
                    of open government, tried to protect the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series from
                    these restrictive impulses, but suffered bureaucratic and policy defeats that
                    forced them to adapt to new constraints. Ironically, the Department published
                    volumes marred by these trends at the end of the decade, just as Cold War
                    tensions eased and long-closed Soviet/Russian and East European archives began
                    to open. Liberalization in the Communist bloc, coupled with the post-Watergate
                    erosion of public trust in the U.S. Government, helped empower transparency
                    reformers as they criticized the disturbing trajectory of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi> series in the late 1980s.</p>
                <p>After considerable debate, Congress affirmed openness as a key tenet of American
                    governmental practice in 1991. The <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute
                    legislated standards and processes for disclosing government records reflecting
                    a “thorough, accurate, and reliable” accounting of past U.S. foreign policy
                    decisions and significant diplomatic activities. The statute also reaffirmed the
                    need to evaluate such records for potential damage their release might cause to
                    diplomatic activities, military operations, intelligence sources and methods,
                    and other sensitivities. In doing so, Congress formalized “responsible
                    transparency” for a new era by building upon two centuries of precedent,
                    pragmatic compromise, adherence to the principle of openness, and evolving
                    perceptions of risk and reward in acknowledging secret deliberations and
                    actions.</p>
                <p>This book traces the evolution of “responsible transparency,” as manifested by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, from the earliest days of
                    the republic through the efforts undertaken across the U.S. Government to
                    implement the 1991 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute. The “responsible” in
                    “responsible transparency” references two interrelated dynamics. The most
                    obvious one is substantive. Too much transparency can damage national security
                    and too little can compromise democratic legitimacy. Most advocates of openness
                    accept limitations on disclosure to protect important interests and the safety
                    of individuals. At the same time, most guardians of security acknowledge that
                    government activities cannot be withheld from the public indefinitely. While
                    often employing rhetorical absolutes, both sides in the debate usually accept a
                    middle ground position influenced by both principle and pragmatism informed by
                    shifting geopolitical and institutional contexts.</p>
                <p>The other, less obvious, dynamic of “responsibility” in “responsible
                    transparency” relates to the authority of those making decisions about releasing
                    or withholding information. The official character of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> provides a public acknowledgement of U.S. Government
                    decisions and actions. Because the series plays this role, it has always
                    received stricter scrutiny than other mechanisms of disclosure, such as the
                    Freedom of Information Act. One result of this “special treatment” is that the
                    series represents, in aggregate, the evolution of official judgments about the
                    costs and benefits of openness. Although these transparency decisions have often
                    embodied technocratic and bureaucratic perspectives, they also reflect
                    democratic control. Congress plays a critical role, through both legislation and
                    oversight activities. Ultimately, however, the President is accountable for the
                    policies, procedures, and regulations devised and administered by the executive
                    branch that determine the extent of openness about U.S. Government foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>Although “responsible transparency” is an inherently normative concept—and,
                    indeed, the contested nature of the norms that it embodies is a central theme of
                    this book—we employ the term descriptively as the outcome of evolving efforts to
                    strike the proper balance between security and openness. The principal exception
                    to our descriptive use of the term occurs as we examine the 1980s, when
                    procedural and policy shifts essentially foreclosed informed debate between
                    advocates of transparency and guardians of security. To reflect the diminished
                    effort to balance security and transparency and the resulting circumscribed
                    nature of the openness regime during this period, we describe it as
                    “translucent” rather than “transparent.”</p>

                    describes the “Contemporaneous <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>” of a “long 19th
                    century” that resonated into the 1920s. <ref target="#chapter-1">Chapter 1</ref>
                    examines the rise of transparency practices during the early republic, when
                    executive branch officials accepted the legitimacy of congressional demands for
                    records and Congress acceded to executive branch discretion to determine the
                    boundaries of openness. <ref target="#chapter-2">Chapter 2</ref> details how the
                    Lincoln administration formalized ad hoc antebellum precedents to inaugurate the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series during the Civil War. This
                    chapter also reconstructs the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> declassification
                    and excision criteria employed to sanitize the documents published in the first
                        <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes and traces their dissemination and
                    consumption. <ref target="#chapter-3">Chapter 3</ref> explores why Secretary of

                    lessons from publishing <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> during the

                    the compiling staff within the Department. This chapter also describes the
                    growing concern about the possible risks of historical transparency among
                    foreign governments and U.S. diplomats, culminating with Franklin Roosevelt’s
                    intervention to veto publication of some volumes during World War II. <ref
                        target="#chapter-7">Chapter 7</ref> recounts controversies surrounding <hi

                    and the Department of State tried and failed to revive a more contemporaneous
                    mission for the series. The furor over the release of the Yalta papers in 1955
                    exposed the risks of politicizing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, empowered
                    guardians of security in the U.S. Government, and spurred the Department to
                    invite the academic community to expand its role in assessing the integrity of
                    the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series. <ref target="#chapter-8">Chapter 8</ref>
                    follows the series through two decades of incremental change and relative
                    stability. It also portrays the development, implementation, and consequences of
                    a major acceleration initiative in the 1970s. <ref target="#chapter-9">Chapter
                        9</ref> illustrates the erosion of transparency of the early 1980s amidst
                    resurgent international tensions, bureaucratic reform, and altered
                    declassification policies. <ref target="#chapter-10">Chapter 10</ref> relates
                    the events leading to the resignation of the chair of <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi>’s scholarly advisory committee and the production of a <hi

                    documentation of a significant (and widely-known) covert operation, which
                    sparked a major crisis for the series in 1990. <ref target="#chapter-11">Chapter
                        11</ref> illustrates the debate surrounding the 1991 legislation that
                    provided a statutory mandate for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series. <ref target="#chapter-12">Chapter 12</ref> follows the implementation of

                <p>As this work shows, officials throughout the U.S. Government engaged in repeated
                    negotiations over the course of more than two centuries to determine the proper
                    balance between public accountability and the requirements of security. The
                    official publication of documents revealing how U.S. foreign policy is
                    determined and implemented raises questions of fundamental importance to the
                    exercise of democracy. How much do the people need to know, and when? What
                    information must be protected and who should decide which documents to release?
                    What criteria should be employed to determine which records to withhold? And how
                    do the ways Americans address these dilemmas affect foreign perceptions about
                    the United States? Such questions have generated considerable controversy since
                    the dawn of the republic, and, since 1861, that debate has repeatedly raged
                    around, within, and behind the pages of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations
                        of the United States</hi> series.</p>
                <p>The history of these controversies illuminates the broader evolution of open
                    government in the United States. As political scientist Stephen Skowronek has
                    observed, “state building is most basically an exercise in reconstructing an
                    already established organization of state power. Success hinges on recasting
                    official power relationships within governmental institutions and on altering
                    ongoing relations between state and society.” He concluded that “states change
                    (or fail to change) through political struggles rooted in and mediated by
                    preestablished institutional arrangements.”<note place="foot" n="2"

                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series, this book shows how policymakers translated
                    abstract values like “security” and “legitimacy” into concrete practice as they
                    developed institutions to select, clear (or declassify), and evaluate the
                    government’s most important foreign policy records. Over time, this expanding
                    array of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> stakeholders inside and outside of the U.S.
                    Government accumulated substantive and procedural knowledge that policymakers
                    employed in their struggles to balance the government’s pursuit of security with
                    its commitment to openness. The outcomes of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> debates,
                    ranging from clearances for individual documents to the purpose, size, and scope
                    of the entire series, reflected the relative power, influence, and autonomy of
                    the various <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> stakeholders. Struggles to define the

                    series occurred precisely because of the important issues at stake. Deciding the
                    extent of the “people’s right to know” has fueled lively debate for over two
                    centuries, as this history demonstrates.</p>

                        dawn of the republic, and drawing on earlier English parliamentary practice,
                        Congress exerted its right to inquire into the basis upon which foreign
                        policy decisions were made. The executive branch, in the person of the
                        president, reserved the power to withhold or restrict release of

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_1240-start" corresp="#b_1240-end"/>During the early
                        republic period, the legislative and executive branches jostled to establish
                        functional intergovernmental communications procedures. The Congress quickly
                        established a habit of calling for reports or executive branch records on a
                        variety of domestic matters. Over time, it became customary for most
                        executive branch agencies to submit annual reports to Congress, although the
                        Department of State never did so. As early as 1790, Congress acceded to the
                        principle that the President might withhold particulars about certain
                        expenditures related to foreign policy. That same year, President George
                        Washington transmitted documents relating to Indian affairs, but insisted
                        that Congress keep the information confidential. Congress also stipulated
                        that certain foreign policy documents, for example, the provisions of
                        treaties ratified by the Senate, should be published at the public
                        expense.</p>

                        operational and constitutional principles. On November 4, 1791, United

                        The House of Representatives formed a committee to investigate the causes of
                        the debacle, and, on March 30, 1792, requested that Secretary of War Henry
                        Knox release documents relevant to the inquest. Given the fundamental nature
                        of the questions involved, and aware that his administration’s decisions
                        would set precedents for relations between the branches of government,
                        Washington convened his Cabinet to consider how to reply. The Cabinet

                        about prerogatives attached to the executive and legislative functions.<note

                            Randolph. For this crucial precedential case, see Jefferson’s March 31

                            specific references address whether the House of Commons possessed the
                            authority to initiate an inquest concerning military affairs (including
                            clandestine spy operations) and how the King’s ministers should respond.
                            The debates took place during the latter period of Robert Walpole’s
                            premiership (late 1730s–early 1740s). The disputants in the Walpole era
                            referenced earlier 18th and 17th century cases that came before
                            Parliament, evidence of the American Founding Fathers’ adherence to
                            English Common Law practices of deference to tradition and
                            precedent.</note> They decided that the Legislative branch did possess
                        the right to request documents from the Executive. As to who should respond,
                        the Cabinet determined that only the President, as head of the Executive
                        branch and therefore responsible for all executive departments’ operations
                        and records, could reply to congressional requests. Concerning what
                        documents the executive branch might submit, they agreed that “the public
                        good”—as defined by the President—must determine the extent of disclosure.
                        In principle, the President should divulge as much material as possible.
                        Nevertheless, if, in the President’s judgment, release of certain documents
                        might harm the important national interests, those records could be
                            withheld.<note place="foot" n="6" xml:id="chapter-1fn6">Hoffman, <hi

                        good” criteria by asking Washington to “cause the proper officers to lay

                    <p>By 1800, this procedure of congressional requests for information with
                        allowances made for reservations had become established practice. The House
                        or Senate asked for documents relating to specific foreign policy issues
                        when they deemed it necessary. Those queries usually deferred to the
                        executive branch by including language to the effect that exceptions could
                        be made if the president judged it necessary to withhold information “in the
                        public interest,” or in consideration of the “public good,” or when “public
                        safety” required. Although much altered in form, this basic approach to
                        sharing information about foreign policy issues continues today.<note

                            recognized from the beginning that various actors might derive very
                            different calculations about what constituted “the public good.” Some
                            members of Congress rejected the legislature’s right to demand documents
                            from the executive because they believed it implied impeachment of the
                            President, or because they feared investigations would be instigated for
                            political purposes. See, for example, statement of William Smith in <hi
                                rend="italic">Annals of Congress</hi>, 2nd Cong., 1st Sess., House,
                            March 27, 1792, p. 491. Secretary of State Jefferson worried that his
                            rival, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, contemplated using the
                            procedure to promote bureaucratic independence from the Chief Executive:
                            when confronted with a congressional directive Hamilton did not wish to
                            obey, he would invoke the shield of executive privilege; if, instead,
                            Hamilton did not wish to follow a presidential instruction, he could
                            release material to Congress that promoted Hamilton’s policy
                            preferences. See note 5 above.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Most importantly, the President’s officials possessed the capacity to control
                        the flow of information. Because executive branch agents created, received,
                        retained, and reviewed the documents, little recourse existed for
                        questioning their determinations about what was in the public interest to
                        divulge. Congress could press for the release of more documents or demand
                        explanations as to why records remained sealed, but legislators acceded to
                        the principle that redacting and withholding constituted appropriate
                        executive functions. Neither branch wished to appeal to the judiciary, nor
                        did the courts want to become embroiled in matters likely to involve
                        ephemeral political considerations. Thus, the executive retained the
                        initiative in defining what constituted “the public interest” or “national
                        security” for the purposes of determining responsible U.S. Government
                        transparency.</p>

                        be of these denominations: (1) what related to Mr. G[ene]t; (2) some harsh

                            prove problematic if revealed to officials of the host nation. Ministers
                            expected their communications with the Secretary of State to remain
                            confidential, at least until the most acute sensitivities

                        the universe of documents subject to release was much smaller than today.
                        Many types of official records now considered essential to reconstructing
                        the policy making process did not then exist. The large bureaucracies of the
                        modern era create multiple types of records that reveal internal
                        decisionmaking processes such as memoranda of conversation, position papers,
                        decision documents, cross-departmental coordination efforts, interagency
                        task force records, detailed accounts of international negotiations, and the
                        like. Until the early 20th century, the federal government was quite small;
                        the Department of State, for example, totaled seven domestic employees in
                            1790.<note place="foot" n="14" xml:id="chapter-1fn14">Department of
                            State, Office of the Historian website <ref

                        If a Department head or the President wished to convene a meeting to
                        determine policy, the principals could easily fit into one room. Little need
                        existed to write down the course of the deliberations, since all key players
                        could be present. Additionally, extant records that recounted certain
                        intra-executive branch functions—for example, the deliberations of Cabinet
                        meetings—would have been considered off limits out of respect for the
                        separation of powers. The House and Senate sometimes met in executive
                        session and treated the records of those deliberations as secret; they could
                        hardly ask the executive to surrender similar documents. Finally,
                        conceptions about what constituted a government record were much more
                        circumscribed. Officials routinely retained their “personal” records when
                        leaving government service, which included correspondence considered
                        “private,” diaries, notebooks, and other documents that may reveal much
                        about the internal workings of government. Indeed, the documentary basis of
                            <ref target="#part-1">Part One</ref> of this book rests largely on the
                        “papers” of leading figures, few of which remained in the possession of the
                        federal government. Until the third decade of the 20th century, Department
                        of State staff assigned to select and transmit documentation to Congress had
                        no authority to consult these records. Consequently, the bulk of the extant
                        record consisted of official correspondence—communications from other
                        governments, messages from U.S. diplomatic officials overseas, instructions
                        written to them, and, sometimes, reports produced for the Secretary of State
                        or the President based largely on those documents. Disclosure of “the
                        record,” then, constituted the release of materials that indicated the
                        inputs to policy as well as the implementation of policy, but which only
                        obliquely revealed the weighing of factors involved in making decisions.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1703"/>The openness expectations of the era were also
                        conditioned by an essentially unregulated confidentiality regime. Unlike
                        today, no laws prohibited executive branch officials from sharing
                        information with legislators, the press, private citizens, or even
                        foreigners. Leaks of sensitive information occurred frequently.
                        Administration officials sometimes released documents selectively to bolster
                        their position or undermine rivals. The executive branch learned that any
                        information sent to Congress, even confidentially, was liable to become
                        public. In hopes of establishing the trust necessary to receive fuller
                        documentation, both Houses of Congress created standing rules requiring
                        their members to maintain the confidentiality of records transmitted by the
                        executive branch. Nevertheless, both the House and Senate asserted the
                        authority to remove the injunction of secrecy from documents they received
                        by majority vote if legislators deemed it in the public interest to do so.
                        The executive acquiesced, acceding to the principle that the people
                        possessed a sovereign right to make informed judgments about the conduct of
                        their public servants.<note place="foot" n="15" xml:id="chapter-1fn15"

                    </p>
                    <p>By the early 19th century, a clear set of reciprocal expectations had
                        developed between the executive and legislative branches. Most importantly,
                        a general agreement existed that a functional republic required
                        well-informed public debate; both branches assumed that the President should
                        share documents regarding foreign affairs with representatives, either
                        voluntarily or when asked, and that as much of that information as possible
                        would be made available to the American people. Every year, the executive
                        branch transmitted to Congress foreign policy records, sometimes in very
                        significant amounts, and often on short notice. The nation’s elected
                        representatives uniformly acknowledged the <hi rend="italic">value</hi> of
                        openness in government operations.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_52"/>Both branches (particularly the executive), however,
                        tempered the value ascribed to transparency. All agreed that the
                        indiscriminate release of information could damage the national interest;
                        the executive branch applied the sorts of excisions identified by Secretary
                        Randolph when officials deemed it necessary. In a few high-profile
                        instances, a case can be made that as early as the 1790s Presidents withheld
                        very important information that might have made a difference in
                        congressional support for administration policies that led to hostilities or
                        resulted in territorial expansion.<note place="foot" n="16"
                            xml:id="chapter-1fn16">Key cases include Washington’s handling of
                            records relating to the controversial Jay Treaty, John Adams’s decisions
                            regarding information releases during the “XYZ Affair,” Jefferson’s
                            Louisiana Purchase negotiations, Madison’s and Monroe’s expeditions into
                            the Floridas, and Madison’s withholding of certain correspondence at the
                            time of the 1812 war vote. For a brief overview, see Sofaer, “Executive
                            Power and the Control of Information,” pp. 8–45.</note> Although those
                        exceptions constituted a very small percentage of the overall information
                        exchange, they nevertheless represented an important practice that would
                        occasionally recur after the institution of regularized, contemporary
                        documentary publication in 1861.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_82"/>Yet even in cases of documents delivered to Congress
                        on a confidential basis, of excisions from released records, and of the
                        withholding of crucial correspondence, Americans assumed as a general rule
                        that those materials would eventually become part of the public record.
                        Beginning in the early 19th century, Congress authorized considerable
                        funding for an extensive program of publishing documents. The U.S. Serial
                        Set, which began publication in 1817, comprised the most comprehensive
                        collection of foreign affairs documentation during the antebellum
                            period.<note place="foot" n="17" xml:id="chapter-1fn17">Anne Morris Boyd

                        However rudimentary when compared with modern standards, by the early 1830s,
                        all the key elements of the transparency-secrecy continuum were in
                        existence, as well as mechanisms to resolve the differences arising
                        therefrom. Those procedures were grounded in a profound tradition—the
                        presumption that elected officials had an obligation to inform the people
                        about what the government had done in their name.</p>

                        in this chapter. On December 3, 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message
                        to Congress with the foreign policy documentation attached. He noted the
                        records briefly at the beginning of his message by stating, “The
                        correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith

                        understanding the modern history of U.S. diplomatic documentation. This

                        volumes issued during the Civil War. Several broad conclusions emerge: these
                        volumes represent a mature expression of the checks and balances between the
                        executive and legislative branches established over the previous seven
                        decades, the editors selected documents with an eye to both domestic and
                        overseas audiences, the volumes tell modern historians what the Lincoln
                        administration wanted U.S. citizens to know about its foreign policy, and
                        the volumes continued a longstanding commitment to promote government
                        openness despite the controversy such efforts generated.</p>

                        President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward participated in the
                        selection of the documents and the publication of the volumes, but one can
                        reasonably surmise that they supported the initiative. It is difficult to
                        imagine important documents being released without their concurrence, or at
                        least their knowledge. In Frederick Seward’s account of his father’s tenure
                        as Secretary of State, he writes that William Seward had a hand in preparing
                        the text of Lincoln’s message, but no mention is made of how the attached
                        documentation was compiled.<note place="foot" n="1" xml:id="chapter-2fn1"

                        context. The Department of State was quite small during the Civil War, with
                        only 42 domestic employees in 1860. A project of this size and visibility
                        could not have escaped the notice of the Secretary.<note place="foot" n="2"

                        opinion about the series, however, is directly available from his own pen.
                        Two years after the release of the first volume, Seward explained the
                        necessity of the publication in an exchange with Charles Francis Adams, U.S.
                        minister in London during the Civil War. On February 11, 1864, Adams sent a
                        despatch to Washington noting that “publication of the Diplomatic papers . .
                        . has elicited much comment in Parliament.” Adams expressed a wish that if
                        diplomatic correspondence were to be published, it would at least be done
                        with adequate context so that his own actions would not come under question
                        in London.<note place="foot" n="3" xml:id="chapter-2fn3">Adams to Seward,

                            December 22, 1862, Vol. II, p. 1099. But Adams also saw the value of
                            publishing the diplomatic record; as he told Earl Russell in November
                            1862 regarding the publication of a note from the Russians to the
                            French: “I expressed my satisfaction with the result, because I thought
                            the publication of these papers in America would tend to correct any
                            impressions which had been made of the disposition of France, to the
                            disadvantage of Great Britain.” Adams to Seward, November 15, 1862,

                            of State, Vol. 24.</note> Seward responded with a lengthy justification.
                        For Seward, publishing documentation had a solid Constitutional basis that
                        harkened back to precedents set as early as the 1790s: “The Constitution of
                        the United States requires the President from time to time to give Congress
                        information concerning the state of the Union.”<note place="foot" n="4"
                            xml:id="chapter-2fn4">Seward’s reference is to Article II, Section 3 of
                            the Constitution.</note> Beyond this Constitutional obligation, Seward
                        noted, “our foreign affairs have . . . been a subject of anxiety as deep as
                        that which is felt in regard to military and naval events.” This widespread
                        interest demanded a response. “The Government continually depends upon the
                        support of Congress and the People, and that support can be expected only in
                        the condition of keeping them thoroughly and truthfully informed of the
                        manner in which the powers derived from them are executed.” Seward linked
                        the publication directly to the exercise of democracy; because the authority
                        of the government derived from the people, the people deserved to see the
                        correspondence which revealed how policy was being carried out.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>Seward reiterated practices and principles enshrined during the early
                        republic, telling Adams that “Congress and the country” had a “right” to see
                        the documents that had caused Adams such consternation. Since “history would
                        be incomplete without that account,” the President had a “duty to
                        communicate it, unless special reason of a public nature existed for
                        withholding it.” Seward did not believe that his correspondence with Adams
                        qualified for this exception, and even if it did, sufficient time had
                        elapsed to justify release: “the question which had called out this dispatch
                        had been for a time put at rest.” Indeed, for Seward the greater error would
                        have been <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to release the documents. Failing to
                        publish the correspondence “would have seemed to imply a confession that it
                        was improper in itself, while to practice reserve on so great a question
                        would be liable to be deemed an abuse of the confidence which Congress and
                        the people had so freely reposed in the Government.” Congress and the
                        American people needed to make an open and honest assessment of the
                        government’s foreign policy, and the publication of these documents enabled
                        the Constitutional framework of accountability to function.<note

                        “Mr. Seward has introduced an unheard of precedent by publishing despatches
                        from all our ministers with the President’s Message, and the folly arises
                        from his pride of authorship—and that alone.”<note place="foot" n="8"

                        correspondence had long been published. Indeed, he lamented the state of the

                            spirit of the Gov’t in not providing proper cases for them. All
                            applications for an appropriation have been treated with silent

                        documents and attaching them to the president’s message represented a novel
                        aspect in that it created a higher profile for the volumes. That heightened
                        visibility carried with it risks for current diplomacy. As Secretary of
                        State Seward remarked to Adams, “it is impossible when writing to you,
                        (however confidentially) to feel sure that when what is expressed, shall
                        ultimately become public, it will not be thought to have been written for
                        effect or to produce an impression upon the British Government.”<note

                        expected to receive documentation reflecting the administration’s actions.

                        important element in the federal government’s system of checks and balances:
                        the executive branch carried out foreign policy, but the legislative branch
                        reserved the right to monitor that policy via these requests for

                        during 1861 the Congress asked for documents, and the executive determined
                        how, when, and whether to comply. Executive branch denials included a
                        refusal to comply with a March 25 Senate resolution requesting the
                        “despatches of Major Robert Anderson to the War Department during the time
                        he has been in command at Fort Sumter.” Lincoln responded the next day that
                        he had “examin[ed] the correspondence thus called for” and decided that it
                        would be “inexpedient” to publish.<note place="foot" n="12"

                        the documentation. The long history of document releases in the pre-Civil
                        War period meant that the Congressmen had every expectation that, absent a
                        substantial reason to withhold, their requests would be satisfied. Two House

                    <p>Lincoln and Seward opted not to respond immediately. Seward replied that it
                        would not be appropriate to share “the correspondence called for” in July

                            featured reports from the Postmaster General, the Commissioner of

                        and wrote briefly about foreign affairs. The principal topic of concern was
                        whether the nascent Confederacy had obtained recognition from any other
                        country. Lincoln expressed confidence about Union diplomatic efforts: “The
                        disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our
                        country, in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad,”
                        he wrote, “have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably
                        expected.” Lincoln noted that all the Confederacy had to offer to foreign
                        countries was the prospect of commerce. As yet, foreign nations were not
                        ready to “discar[d] all moral, social, and treaty obligations” in order to
                        maintain trading relations.<note place="foot" n="18" xml:id="chapter-2fn18">

                        first document in the volume indicated continuity from the previous
                        administration. In a circular from James Buchanan’s Secretary of State,
                        Jeremiah Black, to ministers abroad on February 28, 1861, Black
                        characterized the November 1860 election as a victory for the “candidate of
                        the republican or antislavery party.” The election “had been confined almost
                        entirely to topics connected, directly or indirectly, with the subject of
                        negro slavery,” and Lincoln was as popular in the North as he was despised
                        in the South. Black noted that President Buchanan “expected” America’s
                        representatives to prevent Confederate agents from gaining recognition.<note

                        important one was ever devolved by the United States upon any representative

                        ministers to be on guard. Although Seward did not believe that the

                        wrote to the U.S. representative there that “political action even of the
                        more commanding or more active States is influenced by a general opinion
                        that is formed imperceptibly in all parts of the Eastern continent. Every

                        Likewise to the minister to Switzerland: “You are in a region where men of

                        and exhausting labors. The world’s affairs are discussed freely, and the

                        The Union could not afford to let Confederates gain a foothold anywhere and
                        wanted its representatives throughout Europe on alert. This meant that
                        ministers would need to know about events in the United States. Seward urged
                        Norman Judd in Berlin to “fix your attention in the first instance, and to
                        keep it constantly fixed, on the actual condition of affairs at home” rather

                        officials felt over Great Britain’s willingness to treat the Confederacy as
                        a belligerent power. Although falling short of full recognition, London’s
                        position tacitly abetted the rebellion.<note place="foot" n="48"
                            xml:id="chapter-2fn48">For example, Howard Jones states that the British
                            “adhered to international law in equating a civil war with a war between
                            nations and then assuming a position of neutrality.” Through belligerent
                            status, the Confederates gained “credibility,” their raids on Union
                            ships were not considered piracy by the British, and Confederates could
                            do business with British merchants. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Blue and
                                Gray</hi>, pp. 51–52.</note> The volume exposed British actions to
                        American citizens. Adams reported to British officials that the Americans
                        were “irritated” by the Queen’s neutrality proclamation, which was seen as
                        “designed to aid the insurgents by raising them to the rank of a belligerent
                        state.” Although Adams demurred that he himself did not believe that the
                        British intended to treat the Confederate states as equal to the Union, he
                        went on to point out that the presence of Southern “pseudo commissioners”
                        presented a continued aggravation. The British Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs, Earl Russell, responded that “it had been the custom both
                        in France and here to receive such persons unofficially for a long time
                        back. Poles, Hungarians, Italians, &amp;c., &amp;c., had been allowed
                        interviews, to hear what they had to say. But this did not imply recognition
                        in their case any more than in ours.”<note place="foot" n="49"

                        U.S. officials, who also rejected offers of British mediation. Another
                        letter from Seward refused the idea of European arbitration: “we cannot

                        emancipation. Slavery certainly received credit for causing the war. Seward
                        emphasized that the rebelling states operated against the will of the entire
                        people. “The Union was formed upon popular consent and must always
                        practically stand on the same basis,” he told Norman Judd in Berlin.<note

                        was the root cause of the desire to break with popular consent. “The
                        attempted revolution is simply causeless,” Seward wrote to Dayton in France.
                        “It is, indeed, equally without a reason and without an object, unless it be

                        that although slavery had existed in all the states at the time of the
                        Revolution, “it was expected that under the operation of moral, social, and
                        political influences then existing the practice of slavery would soon
                        cease.” The “cause” of the rebellion was the fact that the slave states,
                        having suffered defeat at the polls, “took an appeal from the verdict of the
                        people, rendered through the ballot-box, to the sword, and organized a

                        provides another way to substantiate the conclusion that they were in part
                        designed to fulfill a public affairs function. Printed in an era before
                        federal law or departmental directive indicated how the public should be
                        informed of excisions, the volumes feature lines of asterisks to indicate
                        excised material. Although we do not know the editorial policy that governed
                        those decisions, a systematic examination of material deleted from
                        despatches can offer some clues. Records from London provide the most
                        important case study, since Great Britain constituted a critical target for
                        the Confederacy. Comparing the London and Washington originals to the copies
                        printed in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> reveals editorial patterns,
                        especially important categories of redaction such as information about
                        efforts to supply the Union with arms, clues about where Adams got his
                        information and his connections with the British Government, tidbits of
                        British politics and gossip, and candid assessments of British opinion about
                        the Union.<note place="foot" n="56" xml:id="chapter-2fn56">For example, the

                            suggest that Seward and Adams may have maintained a separate channel of
                            communication: “Last week I received and acknowledged a Despatch,
                            likewise numbered 876. The mistake I presume to have arisen from
                            attaching a number 874 to a Despatch strictly confidential and evidently

                        sensitive to publish. In a despatch of August 16, 1861, Adams wrote that a
                        Mr. Schuyler had arrived and would be overseeing “the whole matter of the
                        selection and supply of arms in Europe as well as of the payment for them.”
                        Adams noted that he had promised Schuyler any assistance he could offer. In
                        his September 2 response, Seward noted that he was “pleased” to learn that
                        Schuyler had arrived, and noted that he “can scarcely be too active or
                            efficient.”<note place="foot" n="57" xml:id="chapter-2fn57">Adams to

                        concerned defectors from the Confederate cause. In 1863, <hi rend="italic"

                        but a portion of Adams’s assessment of his character was excised: “I think I

                        his connections to the British Government. Adams’s despatch of May 17, 1861
                        noted an upcoming debate in the House of Lords on the Queen’s neutrality
                        proclamation. Adams wrote that “the tone” of the newspaper report on the
                        debate was not “generally such as I could wish,” and that he would be
                        energetic in applying the appropriate pressure. Excised from the passage was
                        Adams’s recounting of his meeting with William Forster, “the leading

                        British debate was left in; the precise information about his contacts was
                        left out. Another example of the editors removing information about Adams’s
                        sources comes from a despatch written in late September 1861. The editors
                        redacted most of its contents, including all of the details about how Adams
                        received an unexpected invitation from Earl Russell to Abergeldie Castle in
                        Scotland. The published version notes that the conversation took place at
                        Abergeldie, but only reproduces that Adams registered a complaint about the
                        “reception of the insurgent privateer, the Sumter” by “authorities at
                        Trinidad.” The majority of the despatch was excised. In it, Adams described
                        his travel, the fact that the journey afforded him “abundant opportunity for
                        full and free conversation” with Russell, a lengthy discussion of European
                        interest in Mexico, and British complaints about “seizure and imprisonment
                        of British subjects.” Adams concluded the despatch by noting that “during
                        the whole of my stay at Abergeldie Castle I thought I perceived the symptoms
                        of a more friendly and cordial feeling than had ever been manifested to me
                        before,” which “fully compensated me for the length and fatigue of the
                        journey.” In this case, the details of Adams’s protest about the friendly
                        treatment afforded Confederate ships was more important (or less sensitive)

                        loss of her mother, to such a degree to render her extremely indisposed to
                        appear or take part in any public proceedings.” Despite the Queen’s
                        condition, Russell arranged for Adams to have an audience with her, which to
                        Adams was too “friendly to admit of any possibility of misconstruction.” The
                        printed portion noted that these arrangements put “an end . . . to all the
                        speculations which have been set afloat in some quarters” about the
                        “probable position of the minister of the United States at this court.” The

                        was,” the editors excised a darker passage: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume contained notable excisions about British
                        public opinion that suggest the sensitive nature of this topic in the
                        volatile early stages of the war. On June 21, 1861, Adams sent to Washington
                        a wide-ranging assessment of divisions in British opinion. Adams’s basic
                        conclusion, “that the British desire only to be perfectly neutral, giving no
                        aid nor comfort to the insurgents,” was published, but the lengthy reporting
                        which led to this conclusion was excluded. To be sure, Adams assessed, there
                        were many who opposed slavery, yet “those who sympathize the most with the
                        position of the Free States as unfavorable to the extension of domestic
                        slavery are the least inclined to favor their policy of war against the
                        Slave States.” Rather, British opponents of slavery seemed to agree with the
                        Confederacy; that there should be a “permanent and peaceful separation” of
                        North and South. The reason? British opponents of slavery “fear a reunion of
                        our States because they think it cannot be effected excepting at the expense
                        of principle. They favor a separation because they think it will keep the
                        Free States consistent and determined enemies of Slavery.” Such arguments
                        must have struck the editors of the 1861 messages as potentially corrosive
                        to Union morale. Into another category fell the “merchants and the
                        manufacturers,” who also “look with great favor on a permanent separation of
                        the States” and assessed the “difficulties” of the United States “in their
                        purely material aspect and in the single interest of their own country.” Yet
                        a third category of opinion was “purely political and purely English.” Here
                        Adams found conservatives who saw the conflict as “the realization of all
                        their predictions of the failure of republicanism in its most portentous
                        form.” This portion of the population “have no preference” for the Union or
                        Confederacy but wanted them to “continue to devour each other.” Adams noted
                        that these three sectors of opinion represented the “very large proportion”
                        of the British population. By contrast, the portion of the population “who
                        really understand the nature of the question at issue and who advocate the
                        cause of the United States as identical with the progress of free
                        institutions all over the world is comparatively insignificant.” Only this
                        last group, Adams noted, saw the war as a “necessity”; all others “consider
                        it as more or less the offspring of mere passion.” Perhaps the Lincoln
                        administration feared the effect on Union morale of suggesting that a large
                        portion of the British population would have been satisfied with Confederate
                        independence. Whatever the reason for its exclusion, the editors deleted
                        Adams’s long discussion of British opinion, along with his statement that
                        Seward’s strong reaction to any “proclivity to a recognition” produced the
                        desired effect. Only the conclusion that Adams was “earnestly assured” that
                        the “sympathy with the government of the United States is general” made it
                        to publication, preserving the appearance of support at the expense of
                        conveying a more complex political situation.<note place="foot" n="67"

                        dealing with battlefield reverses. On August 16, 1861, Adams wrote that the
                        effect of Union defeat at Bull Run was more damaging because of the
                        “ridicule it exposes the country to” rather than the “positive loss”
                        stemming from the battle itself. Reports in the European press did not help
                        the Union cause. Adams noted that the “military spirit of Europe does not
                        reconcile itself to such scenes as have been distinctly painted by the
                        European correspondent of the London Times, and the American press, as well

                        deleted portion, Adams admitted that were he to take a “strong tone” in the
                        midst of such ridicule regarding Bull Run, he would “scarcely likely do more
                        than to provide a smile” on the faces of his interlocutors. Rather, Adams
                        wrote, he should “await an hour doubtless not far distant when the people of
                        the United States will have redeemed their reputation for judgment and skill
                        and courage” and have proven that they can survive war “without the guidance
                        or control of the military or civil officers of the slaveholding States.”
                        The editing process for the volume retained the demand for a conference and
                        its topic, but excised the embarrassing reasons for Adams’s delay.<anchor

                        editorial approach developed during 1861 continued through the remainder of
                        the war. The volume communicates several clear themes. Seward immediately
                        wrote to representatives abroad and instructed them to resist the efforts of
                        Confederate agents to secure recognition and to demand that countries refuse
                        Confederate ships succor at their ports. The correspondence reveals a range
                        of responses from around the globe: some governments declared their support
                        for the Union, others pledged a neutrality that partially legitimized the
                        Confederates. The documentation from the ministers illustrated the arguments
                        used to sway foreign governments. Moreover, the records indicate that
                        several ministers, as well as Seward himself, placed slavery at the center
                        of the factors causing war.</p>

                        item, and praised the publication: “The diplomatic correspondence submitted

                        relations with foreign Powers as could have been anticipated. This is
                        doubtless owing in a great degree to the firm and decided position
                        maintained by Secretary Seward in his official intercourse with these

                        had clearly not yet made it over the telegraph lines: “He refers to the
                        correspondence with foreign powers,” the paper noted, “but does not discuss
                        them in detail, or even give us a clue to their contents. So the public must
                        wait for information on that score, till the diplomatic correspondence be

                        Others took heart from the correspondence that Seward would continue to act
                        appropriately in the future. “The masterly ability which Gov. SEWARD has

                        “high-toned” and “courteous” messages were “as nearly perfect models of
                        diplomatic correspondence as are to be found on the pages of modern
                        history.” The correspondence with Adams and Dayton “have swept to the winds
                        all the aspersions of those who have accused him of favoring a timid and

                        exist.” The paper praised Seward for his “assured and firm” tone and his
                        faith that the country, “reunited, will be stronger and more prosperous than

                        the paper put a different spin on the correspondence; rather than depicting
                        Seward as standing strong in the face of an unfavorable British and French
                        response, the paper focused on the response itself: “It will thus be seen
                        that the relations between the United States and Great Britain and France
                        were far from being securely amicable before the arrest of Mason and
                        Slidell, that there were issues between them of great irritation and danger,

                    <p>The extent of newspaper response to the 1861 volume illustrates the important
                        domestic function that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> served. Newspapers across
                        the country—including the Midwest and the West Coast—printed the
                        correspondence directly (or an analysis of it), and many papers praised
                        Seward, the decision to publish the correspondence, and the contents of the
                        publication. Created in response to a request from Congress, the volume
                        fulfilled its domestic purpose by informing the national discussion about
                        Union diplomacy.<note place="foot" n="83" xml:id="chapter-2fn83"><anchor

                            impact of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, one aspect of foreign reaction is
                            worth noting. Shortly after the volume was released, Lord Richard Lyons,
                            British Minister to the United States, sent a copy to Secretary of State
                            for Foreign Affairs Earl Russell. Russell received the correspondence on
                            December 25. Lyons obviously attempted to get his hands on the
                            publication as soon as possible: “As the earliest copies did not come
                            from the press until yesterday afternoon,” he apologized, “I have not
                            had time to do more than read somewhat hastily that part of the
                            correspondence which relates to England and France.” He then recounted
                            what he considered the highlights of the documents, chiefly the reaction
                            of the United States to the British and French willingness to treat the
                            Confederacy as a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government and
                            Washington’s contention that Confederates should be treated as pirates.

                        ‘carry the whole business of his department in his hat.’ It is as much as I

                        increased publication program. After release of the 1862 volume, one
                        pamphleteer accused Seward of prompting the House to ask for records as an
                        excuse for the Secretary to produce a lengthy propaganda instrument. In a
                        complaint that would be voiced repeatedly in subsequent years, the author
                        feared that release of recent, sensitive information damaged U.S. interests
                        by unnecessarily causing affront to other nations. The author, probably a
                        former Buchanan administration official, also criticized Seward’s writing
                        style, evinced pro-McClellan sentiments, railed against the “acrid”
                        abolitionist movement, and lamented that the 1862 volume exemplified “fierce
                        fanaticism” by an overweening executive bent on destroying the separation of
                            powers.<note place="foot" n="89" xml:id="chapter-2fn89">A Northern Man,

                        overwhelming majority of commentators marshaled multiple arguments in
                        support of rapid, widespread release of substantial diplomatic
                        correspondence. Members of Congress certainly understood the value of <hi

                        public diplomacy, and informing their own deliberations. Theodore Pomeroy
                        (R–NY) noted, “there is no man in this country who does not know that the
                        public interest within the past year has been more drawn to our foreign
                        intercourse than to any other subject in our political history. Foreign
                        intervention is the rock upon which the world at large and our enemies at
                        home expected us to split. There is no subject upon which to-day the people
                        of this country demand and have a right to demand light more than upon that
                        subject.” Henry Winter Davis (Unconditional Unionist–MD) supported printing
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> because the diplomatic
                        correspondence <quote rend="blockquote">

                                allowed to state it in that form it will be driven to the very

                                official in form, for which we are responsible, and carrying with it

                            received the designation, and the number of depository libraries
                            increased in subsequent years. In addition, federal agencies, the White

                        to be assassinated, Lincoln’s death presented a test of the constitutional
                        plan of succession. Some governments noted this fact, signaling the
                        legitimacy of Andrew Johnson’s administration in the eyes of the world
                        community. The response from China, for example, embodied both regret and
                        reassurance that the transfer of power was perceived as smooth. Prince Kung,
                        Chief Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, wrote on July 8, 1865, that
                        the announcement of Lincoln’s death “inexpressibly shocked and startled me.”
                        Nevertheless, the news that “on the same day the Vice-President succeeded to
                        the position without any disturbance, and the assassin had been arrested, so
                        that the affairs of government were going on quietly as usual” seemed to
                        satisfy the Prince’s worry, and he hoped that these facts would also
                        “alleviate your grief at the event.”<note place="foot" n="111"

                        messages from ordinary people. Within the United States, city councils,
                        benevolent societies, spontaneous assemblies of citizens, religious
                        organizations, chambers of commerce, corporation boards of directors,
                        college trustees, social clubs, and veterans’ organizations all submitted
                        declarations, resolutions, and even poems memorializing Lincoln. Some came
                        from groups of immigrants so recently arrived that the messages included
                        translations into English, and others from Mexican, French, or Portuguese
                        expatriates resident in the United States. Condolences even arrived from
                        southern cities, including a resolution passed by an overflow crowd in
                        Savannah, Georgia, which had been occupied by Federal troops for less than
                        four months. A group of Freemasons in France wrote to Johnson that they
                        “wish[ed] to express to you their sentiments of admiration, gratitude, and
                        regret for Lincoln, and their profound sympathy for the government of which

                        unique communications platform that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> provided the
                        U.S. government. As an official record, <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> could send “messages”—to Congress, to the U.S. public, to
                        American diplomats abroad, and to other governments and peoples. Those
                        communications routinely included factual information and policy positions,
                        but <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> could be used for special purposes as well.
                        The “Lincoln Volume” afforded the opportunity, however tragic the occasion,
                        to combine public affairs and public diplomacy. The volume not only gave
                        voice to a global expansion of solidarity and support, but also demonstrated
                        the resiliency of the American system of government. The peaceful transition
                        of power at a time of national crisis provided an object lesson, and also a
                        demonstration, of U.S. strength.</p>

                        the context surrounding the birth of the series that illustrates important
                        themes that recur into the 21st century. The <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series did not spring fully formed from the head of
                        Seward or Lincoln, but rather represented an important step in the evolution
                        of a process ongoing since the early republic. Rather than a project
                        conceived in the executive branch to promote its own purposes, the process
                        of sharing information exemplifies checks and balances between the branches
                        of government: the executive formulates and implements foreign policy, while
                        the legislative oversees the conduct and content of that policy. In the
                        early 1860s, Congress and the executive branch regularized a long-standing
                        tradition of request for, and delivery of, documentation relating to foreign
                        affairs, with certain limitations understood by both parties. “Under our
                        form of Government,” Senator James Brooks (D–NY) argued in 1864, “we are
                        entitled to all the information from the Executive which is not detrimental
                        to the public interests.”<note place="foot" n="117" xml:id="chapter-2fn117">

                            April 29, 1864, p. 1967.</note> Even though Brooks included the standard
                        public interest caveat, he fully expected to receive sufficient
                        documentation to pass judgment on the executive’s conduct of foreign policy.
                        Indeed, the Department of State released significant quantities of
                        information every year, both before 1861 and after 1865.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_520"/>Moreover, congressional representatives and
                        Department employees increasingly viewed publication of foreign policy
                        documents as a normative governmental function. Benjamin Moran recognized as
                        much in 1862 when referring to an incident between Adams and Russell: “When
                        the correspondence shall be published, there will be a good deal of
                        sarcastic comment in the newspapers at his expense on this confession that
                        might have been saved.”<note place="foot" n="118" xml:id="chapter-2fn118"

                        to light. With little fanfare, the Department of State assumed a
                        responsibility that it continues to hold today: to disseminate foreign
                        affairs documentation, according to a coherent organizational scheme, on a
                        regular basis.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_177"/>The volumes also performed a multifaceted public
                        affairs/public diplomacy function, indicating what the government wanted
                        both the American people and foreign observers to know about U.S. policy. It
                        is clear from the correspondence written by the Secretary of State in 1861
                        and subsequent debates in Congress over the cost of printing that the
                        Department intended the volume to serve as a public relations tool. On the
                        one hand, the volume’s contents appealed to multiple domestic audiences.
                        Congress wanted tens of thousands of copies for its own distribution.
                        Newspapers and concerned citizens across the country also read the volumes
                        to judge how their contents reflected the wisdom and competence (or lack
                        thereof) of the Lincoln administration. The documents also played to
                        official and non-elite audiences overseas. The early <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes painted a picture of Seward firing off instructions
                        around the world, ordering American ministers to parry Confederate advances
                        in other lands. Demonstrating American resolve and exposing the willingness
                        of Great Britain and France to treat the Confederates as legitimate
                        belligerents yielded public relations benefits at home and abroad.<anchor

                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, the volumes represent the high value placed on
                        openness as a fundamental element of democratic governance. Seward’s 1864
                        missives to Adams justifying publication of sensitive documents on grounds
                        of responsibility to the electorate reflect a profound belief in the
                        importance of transparency in governmental operations. Even in time of war,
                        responsible government required public accountability for actions taken in
                        the name of the people. In a mid-19th century world that featured few
                        representative governments, and in which the European liberal revolutions of
                        1848–1849 failed, the U.S. Civil War threatened to undermine the principal
                        bastion of republican institutions. As the above quote from Brooks
                        indicates, Americans expected their government to operate transparently,
                        albeit within the bounds of public interest; examining the material excised
                        from early <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes indicates that the people did
                        not learn everything about foreign policy. That the publication of
                        recently-created foreign policy documents sparked some controversy indicated
                        the health, rather than debility, of the American system. Insofar as the
                        record enables us to judge, Seward seems to have grasped this point, and his
                        views appear representative of the majority of government officials and
                        ordinary citizens during that era.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_1263"/>Nevertheless, a careful examination of material
                        excluded from early <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes also illustrates the
                        limitations government officials imposed on openness. Put in 21st century
                        terms, the editors censored material that they believed would damage
                        national security, hinder the war effort, reveal information-gathering
                        sources and methods, or violate privacy considerations. The tension between
                        the desire for transparency and the responsibility to protect played out
                        within the confines of the executive branch; Congress and the public had to
                        trust that the President and Secretary of State would share as much
                        information as possible. This enduring dynamic became increasingly
                        problematic during the 20th century, and calculating what constitutes
                        “responsible release” remains a key issue today.</p>
                    <p>Waging war against the Confederacy required not only fighting on battlefields
                        but also combating their envoys in foreign lands as well as campaigning for
                        support among multiple constituencies at home and abroad. Building on the
                        tradition of publishing diplomatic correspondence that began in the early
                        republic, the first <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes marked an important
                        stage in the evolution of informing politicians and the public about foreign
                        affairs. The unknown Department employees who created the first volume
                        probably could not have envisioned the massive undertaking that <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> would become in the 20th century, but they would
                        no doubt applaud the fundamental purpose: to create a public record of U.S.
                        foreign policy, enabling citizens to assess the work of their government. In
                        subsequent generations, the value ascribed to openness and transparency in
                        governmental operations has remained a key factor informing the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series, even as the changing role of America in
                        the world has modified and transformed implementation of those values. The
                        Civil War spawned the “Contemporaneous <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>,”
                        fostering openness practices that would remain normative for another
                        half-century.</p>

                        March 17, 1869, Fish also confronted political-constitutional quandaries.
                        Grant had neglected to consult with the powerful chair of the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee, Charles Sumner (R–MA), whose arrogance the president
                        abhorred, before appointing Fish. In return, Sumner became an implacable
                        opponent of Grant’s foreign policy and insinuated himself and his committee
                        into Department business whenever possible. By year’s end, Fish was
                        disgusted with what he considered the Senate’s blatant overstepping of its
                        prerogatives. “The Senate, in fact Congress, but especially the Senate,
                        [has] encroached largely beyond the former line of demarcation between their
                        powers and those of the Executive,” Fish complained. “They still claim the
                        same extent of power; they wish, practically, to dictate nominations, not
                        merely to ‘advise and consult.’ The constitutional power of the Senate is
                        limited to yea or nay upon the names submitted to them.”<note place="foot"

                        any more information about foreign affairs than he deemed absolutely
                        necessary. Fish worked with Grant to include general statements about U.S.
                        foreign policy in the President’s December 1869 annual message to Congress,
                        but for the second consecutive year, no diplomatic correspondence
                        accompanied the chief executive’s address to the legislative branch.
                        Congress, and by extension the nation’s citizens, would have to accept the
                        President’s unsubstantiated appraisal of the nation’s foreign policy and
                        international prospects.</p>

                        preparation of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume for 1869.
                        On December 6 (the date of the President’s message), instead of submitting a
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume, Fish responded to a nine-month old
                        congressional request for a report on the clerical force in the Department.
                        Fish reminded Speaker of the House James G. Blaine (R–ME) that during the
                        prior year Congress slashed the number of Department employees from 48 to
                        31. “No [further] reduction in the number or compensation of the clerks now
                        employed is compatible with the public interests,” Fish told Blaine, adding
                        pointedly, “With so large a reduction the business of the Department is
                        already seriously embarrassed.”<note place="foot" n="8"

                        Fish reminded him “that the period alluded to embraces that in which many
                        changes in the diplomatic agents of the government were made. The clerical
                        force in the Department was small and much occupied at the close of the

                            to assure him that, unlike many European countries, Spain included,
                            which had rushed to grant the Confederacy belligerent rights in 1861,
                            the United States would not do so in the case of Cuba. Reflecting his
                            growing impatience with the stalemate on the island, Fish told the

                        branch prerogatives. On the contrary, he hardened his determination to give

                        18th century failed. The executive branch maintained the right to withhold
                        certain information to protect the public interest, and cabinet records,
                        personal papers, and Presidential documents remained outside the purview of

                        prerogative to obtain the documentation necessary to assess the president’s

                        erupted in turmoil. For nearly two decades, Emperor Napoleon III had
                        supported the Papal States as a way to ensure a divided and subservient
                        Italy on France’s southeastern border. But Italian nationalists chipped away
                        at the French and papal domain until only Rome and the province of Latium
                        remained. In August 1870, Napoleon III recalled the French garrison from
                        Rome to reinforce his army for war against the German states. Abandoned by
                        his French ally, Pope Pius IX and his papal guard stood alone against the
                        tide of Italian opinion, which demanded that the Italian government relocate
                        from Florence to the historic capital of Rome—by force if necessary. Even as
                        popular agitation for an end to the temporal power of the pope grew,
                        indecision gripped the Italian government. Not until the resounding French
                        defeat at Sedan and the Prussian capture of Napoleon III on September 1 did
                        the Italian government decide to act, and then it did so haltingly. Italian
                        King Victor Emmanuel II offered Pius IX a face-saving proposal that would
                        have allowed the Italian army to enter Rome peacefully under the guise of
                        protecting the Pope, but Pius remained intransigent. On September 10, Italy
                        declared war on the Papal States. The Italian army crossed the Papal
                        frontier the next day, but was slow to move on Rome. Finally, after brushing
                        aside token resistance on September 20, the Italian army entered the city.
                        Pope Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican, and the Italian
                        government again vacillated, not moving the capital from Florence to Rome
                        until July 1871.</p>
                    <p>Minister Marsh tried to make sense of the confused events of the first days
                        of September and report his interpretation to Secretary Fish. With the
                        Italian government not knowing where it stood from one day to the next,
                        Marsh was bound to err—and to grow frustrated. Both his errors and
                        frustration were made manifest in four despatches he sent Fish between
                        September 1 and the fall of Rome on September 20. Marsh’s September 9 note
                        retracted the hurried assessment he initially offered on September 6.<note

                            <p>The Italian government has long hesitated in the adoption of a
                                decided policy, and in fact it has been so constantly in the habit
                                of blindly following the dictation of the Emperor of France in the
                                conduct of all its foreign relations, without attempting to mark out
                                a policy for itself, that since the downfall of the empire silenced
                                its oracle the ministry has been completely bewildered and quite
                                unable to arrive at a conclusion of any subject until forced by the
                                fear of popular violence to decide upon the military occupation of
                                the Papal territory.</p>
                            <p>Its future course in this matter, unless controlled by external
                                forces, will be characterized by vacillation, tergiversation, and
                                duplicity, as it has always been since 1864, and I see no reason to
                                hope that any measures originated by this or any probable future
                                cabinet will tend to settle the question upon any terms which ought
                                to be acceptable to the Italian people.</p>
                        </quote> The combat deaths of 53 Italian soldiers within a week of that
                        message hardly constituted a policy of “vacillation,” so Marsh hastened to
                        report in a fourth, confidential despatch the day after Rome fell: “the
                        purposes, or at least professions, of the ministry have changed very
                        suddenly, although . . . the minister of foreign affairs only last week
                        declared in the most explicit manner to eminent statesmen opposed to the
                        movement that the Italian troops could never enter Rome, and that they would
                        simply occupy strategic points, none of which would probably be within
                        twenty miles of the city.”<note place="foot" n="30" xml:id="chapter-3fn30">

                        upon Marsh’s judgment and effectiveness. Unfriendly readers might conclude
                        Marsh lacked access to the upper ranks of the Italian Government (only one

                        in November 1870, but his seat was far from secure, and he continued to hope
                        for a diplomatic post. Bingham subsequently lost the November 1872 election,
                        and a month later he renewed his quest for Marsh’s job.</p>

                        domestic or international notice when published in December 1870, suddenly
                        came to the attention of the Italian press in January 1872. The very day an
                        Italian newspaper printed excerpts from the correspondence, Marsh dined with
                        Italian foreign minister Emilio Visconti-Venosta. Instead of demanding
                        Marsh’s recall, however, Venosta greeted him warmly. He understood that
                        Marsh had “but done his duty in thus reporting events, unpleasing as that
                        report was.” Former Prime Minister Bettino Ricasoli, who also was present,
                        strode across the room to “salute Mr. Marsh in a most marked manner, as if
                        to say, ‘You told the truth.’”<note place="foot" n="31"

                        confidential correspondence of such recent vintage, newspapers unanimously
                        condemned the action, noting the larger ramifications for American
                        diplomacy. Many who came to Marsh’s support suspected either a leak for
                        political purposes or general Departmental incompetence (or both) because

                        the personal aspects of Italian politics with the freedom which was
                        perfectly proper in a confidential communication,” the paper editorialized.
                        “But his letter was printed—through some unpardonable mismanagement in the

                        policy issue of the postbellum era. By October 1872 the savage rebellion

                        in sight. Although personally sympathetic to the rebels’ cause, Secretary

                        and expropriated American estates on the island, rumors abounded of

                        Spain’s poor record of reform, its failure to abolish slavery in Cuba, and
                        the American response. Acknowledging that emancipation “may be a difficult
                        task” because Spanish slaveholders had been able to block enactment of such
                        legislation in 1870, he questioned Spanish sovereignty over the island. “If
                        Spain permits her authority to be virtually and practically defied in that
                        island by a refusal or neglect to carry into effect acts of the home
                        government of a humane tendency, is not this tantamount to an acknowledgment
                        of inability to control?” The Grant administration had repeatedly prevented
                        “reckless adventurers . . . and other partisans of the insurgents” residing
                        in the United States from embarking on “hostile expeditions” against the
                        colonial government. In “discharging those duties . . . we are conscious of
                        no neglect,” wrote Fish, “but the trial to our impartiality by the want of
                        success on the part of Spain in suppressing the revolt is necessarily so
                        severe that unless she shall soon be more successful it will force upon this
                        Government the consideration of the question, whether duty to itself and to
                        the commercial interests of its citizens may not demand some change in the
                        line of action it has thus far pursued.” Turning next to the “causeless
                        seizure in violation of treaty obligations” of American estates, Fish
                        reminded Sickles that “there will readily occur to you several cases which
                        have been referred backward and forward between Madrid and Havana to the
                        very verge of the exhaustion of all patience.” And then came the menacing
                        instructions: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                must not be surprised to find, as the inevitable result of delay, a
                                marked change in the feeling and in the temper of the people and of

                        very delicate situation that ultimately failed to resolve the issue. On
                        November 24, the day after Sickles received Instruction No. 270, Spanish
                        Minister of State Cristino Martos y Balbi confidentially shared with him a
                        soon-to-be-promulgated cabinet agreement that would abolish slavery and
                        institute sweeping reforms in Puerto Rico by executive decree, but that
                        rejected a change of course in Cuba until the insurgents surrendered.
                        Sickles then delivered his instructions orally to Martos. Five days later,
                        Sickles read them again to Martos, who copied the paragraph containing the
                        thinly veiled threat.<note place="foot" n="41" xml:id="chapter-3fn41">Daniel

                        President Grant’s December message to Congress, Martos feared that “anything
                        like a hostile demonstration coming from the United States at this moment
                        would greatly embarrass Spain by depriving her concession of that
                        spontaneous character so essential to her independence and dignity.” But,
                        Martos added, the Spanish Government could not inaugurate reforms in Cuba
                        until it had pacified the island.<note place="foot" n="42"

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_784"/>Finding that No. 270 had not succeeded, Fish decided
                        to apply more tangible pressure. He persuaded Grant to include in his annual
                        message a recommendation for high discriminatory duties upon goods from
                        slaveholding countries—Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Brazil. This would satisfy
                        Cuba sympathizers in Congress without exciting jingoism; it also would ruin
                        Spanish sugar growers, upon whose profits the slave trade flourished. Fish
                        intimated to Spanish minister Admiral Luis Polo that a heavy blow was about
                        to fall on Cuban sugar interests. Polo, in turn, arrived at Fish’s doorstep
                        the day before Grant’s message was to go forward with a promise from his
                        government to “concede to Cuba” what it was about to offer to Puerto
                            Rico.<note place="foot" n="43" xml:id="chapter-3fn43">Nevins, <hi

                        <anchor xml:id="b_217"/>Fish’s fears proved well-founded, and Congress began
                        to move in ways that threatened to curtail his options. A bill calling for
                        immediate emancipation in Puerto Rico sailed through the Spanish Senate in
                        late December, but Martos retracted Polo’s pledge to Fish about Cuba.
                        Meanwhile, in the U.S. Congress, Senator Frank P. Blair (D–MO) had
                        introduced a resolution endorsing a Colombian circular proposing that Latin
                        American republics ask the United States to unite with them in urging Spain
                        to grant Cuba independence. House Foreign Affairs Chair Nathaniel P. Banks
                        indicated his intention to propose a resolution demanding Grant take firm
                        action to protect American interests in Cuba.<note place="foot" n="45"

                        was published on January 8, 1873, the press reacted to Instruction No. 270
                        with a mix of wonder, admiration, skepticism, and fear. This “surprising
                        manifestation of backbone” on the part of Secretary Fish, said the <hi
                            rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, was “a plain hint that a new line of
                        action will be adopted.” The next day, however, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Herald</hi> expressed more skepticism. “Since [No. 270] was written,
                        the State department appears to have relapsed into a state of indifference,
                        being satisfied, we suppose, with having made the usual red-tape
                        demonstration . . . making this great Republic appear ridiculous in the eyes
                        of the world and creating disgust in the minds of the American people.” But
                        the <hi rend="italic">Cincinnati Commercial</hi> worried that Fish’s
                        “ominous” despatch might lead to war. “We can not help thinking that the
                        language of Secretary Fish must have amazed the Spanish government. It is
                        not often that such language is used in diplomatic despatches unless it be
                        meant as a prelude to hostilities.”<note place="foot" n="46"

                        was asked for,” averred Fish, “so that, diplomatically speaking, the
                        government has received no such communication; but the Spanish government
                        has full knowledge of the latest views of this government on the subject of
                        slavery in the Spanish West Indian possessions, whatever they may say in the
                        Cortes.” Fish’s explanation left the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>
                        cold. “We would suggest that the American people had quite sufficient of
                        this diplomatic humbug . . . and they would like now a little plain,
                        intelligible language. We have had enough intrigue, deception, and
                        underhanded influence in all our recent transactions with the Spanish
                        government. Now let us know where the responsibility rests.”<note

                        Privately, Fish told Spanish Minister Polo that he had done Spain a favor in
                        publishing No. 270 and related correspondence. “The publication of the
                        letters submitted with the president’s December 2 message to Congress was
                        necessary,” Fish insisted, “to satisfy Congress that the administration had
                        the subject in hand; that the danger has been and is one of the question of
                        Congressional debate, which would give occasion to the utterance of many
                        hard things and would agitate the public mind.” Fish implored Polo to ask
                        his government to desist from further denials or controversial statements on
                        the matter.<note place="foot" n="52" xml:id="chapter-3fn52">Fish diary,

                        have “the subject in hand.” American opinion was hardening toward
                        intervention in Cuba. The press expected Grant to take a firm stand in his
                        March 4, 1873 inaugural address. On February 3, Banks reported out a
                        resolution asking Grant to talk informally with European governments about
                        joint measures to protect non-combatants in Cuba, hasten emancipation, and
                        promote peace.<anchor xml:id="b_371-end" corresp="#b_371-start"/></p>
                    <p>Fish escaped the dilemma when, on February 9, Spain declared for a republic.
                        The well-meaning but ineffectual King Amadeus abdicated, and the two
                        chambers of the Cortes coalesced into a National Assembly. Fish telegraphed
                        Sickles to recognize the republican government as soon as it was fully
                        established. Sickles apparently exceeded his instructions and announced that
                        the United States had “determined to cooperate as far as it depends upon
                        them in bringing the insurrection in Cuba to an end.” Not even the
                        interventionists objected. Most Americans rejoiced at the birth of a new
                        republic in the monarchical Old World.<note place="foot" n="53"

                        forces that Fish could not control. Although Fish’s diplomatic high-wire act
                        succeeded—he managed to pressure Spain, defend American commercial
                        interests, prevent congressional action, placate domestic opponents, and
                        avoid war—employing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> for public “message sending”
                        threatened the delicate balance among persuasion, compromise, coercion, and
                        face-saving upon which diplomacy depends. Moreover, attempts to manipulate
                        the volumes’ content brought into question the integrity of the series,
                        which never sat well with Congress, the press, or the public. With the
                        spectacular additional cautionary example provided by James G. Blaine

                        persuaded Secretary Fish and his successors to avoid overtly manipulating

                        Hamilton Fish began soliciting input from the field in determining which

                            687–688, Tyler Dennett asserted without attribution that complaints from

                            only from 1874–1876. See for instance Leopold, “The Foreign Relations

                        administration abandoned the experiment, this short-lived initiative
                        illustrates the perennial tension between the value of openness and concerns
                        to protect secrecy in a 19th century context. Ultimately, officials in
                        Washington retained the authority to make such determinations.</p>

                        the year prior. Of the 37 ministers, 12 submitted lists of despatches they
                        considered worthy (or at least safe) for publication. Several of the
                        ministers also identified passages they wished to see omitted from the
                        published record. In cases including China, France, Italy, Mexico, Russia,
                        and Sweden, the Department published only those despatches that the
                        ministers had recommended and excised all passages of concern to the
                        ministers. The Department also took care not to publish potentially
                        controversial despatches from these legations received subsequent to the
                        ministers’ requests.<note place="foot" n="63" xml:id="chapter-3fn63">B. P.

                            reached.” Because both British press and local press had reported on the
                            affair, the Department probably felt compelled to put something on
                            record. For press coverage of the affair see especially the <hi

                        as a public diplomacy tool. Andrews implored Fish to include in the 1876
                        volume two lengthy reports he had written on the subjects of pauperism and
                        civil service reform in Sweden, both of which reflected well on the
                        Scandinavian country. He also asked Fish to print 300 extra copies of each
                        separately for his own use, and to provide him extra copies of <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1876 to distribute to Swedish
                        universities. It is not known whether the Department printed the reports
                        separately as Andrews asked, but they did appear in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi>, 1876. Andrews was delighted. He gave his
                        counterpart a copy of the volume. The Swedish Government translated Andrews’
                        report on the civil service and published it in their official journal. “As
                        I have never before known of such a proceeding by the Foreign Office, I
                        could not but feel flattered at the notice,” he wrote.<note place="foot"

                        advised that “selections should be made only from those which relate to the

                        conjunction with supplementary irregular releases (discussed later in this
                        chapter), became a regular of part of executive-legislative interaction,
                        Departmental operations, diplomatic calculations, and public civic
                        discourse. The signal feature of the later 19th–early 20th century series
                        and the supplementary submissions to Congress that complemented the bound
                        volumes was timeliness: the U.S. Government routinely published foreign
                        policy records within a year (and sometimes within a few weeks) of their
                        creation. Most Americans believed this immediate form of openness, which
                        informed both the electorate and the elected, to be essential to the proper
                        exercise of democratic, responsible government. This chapter outlines the
                        expression of those republican values, as exemplified by the
                        “Contemporaneous <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>,” in their 19th and early 20th
                        century setting.</p>

                    <p>Congress comprised the most important audience for the Contemporaneous <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. In accordance with practices established in the
                        1790s, the House and Senate requested records as they saw fit, and the
                        Department frequently released records throughout the year. In addition, by
                        1870 Hamilton Fish had concluded that the Department could most efficiently
                        meet Congressional expectations by producing one or more general volumes of
                        documentation not previously transmitted to the legislative branch.
                        Consequently, it is important to take account of both types of releases when
                        considering the total dissemination of foreign policy documents after

                        bound volumes became a routine part of Department business. Between 1870 and
                        1880 the Department transmitted selected correspondence for the year
                        concurrently with the President’s annual December message to Congress for

                        following year, with publication normally occurring between April and

                        time Congress reduced the minimum print run to 4,682 copies (see <ref

                        calling on the President to transmit diplomatic correspondence on issues of
                        interest to Congress. These periodic submissions were published most
                        frequently as Senate or House Executive Documents and occasionally as

                        consisted of instructions, despatches, and telegrams—the same type of
                        material presented in the same fashion as in <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        before declaration of war in 1898, as well as large tranches of records
                        transmitted confidentially to Congress within a few weeks of the formal
                        cessation of hostilities.</p>
                    <p>The timely transmittal of what we term “Supplemental <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> Submissions”—fully integrated with the “regular” annual <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes—demonstrated the
                        Department’s recognition of the foreign-policy prerogatives of the
                        legislative branch as well as the need to respond promptly and as
                        comprehensively as possible to its requests for information. From 1868 to
                        1914, the Department of State submitted over 16,000 pages of diplomatic
                        correspondence <hi rend="italic">in addition</hi> to the documents included
                        in the “regular” annual <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> publications—the
                        equivalent of roughly <hi rend="italic">20</hi> additional <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes (see <ref target="#appendix-c">appendix
                            C</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Through the first decade of the 20th century, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series, when considered together with the frequent
                        Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions of diplomatic
                        correspondence to Congress that complemented the annual volumes, established
                        itself as a reliable primary source for United States foreign policy.
                        Consisting primarily of correspondence, these records can be considered as
                        complete as possible, taking into account the very small number of documents
                        redacted in part or in whole according to 19th century standards for
                        withholding, and given that Presidential records such as Cabinet minutes
                        remained off limits and contemporaries did not consider “personal” documents
                        such as diaries and private letters government records. As the Supplemental
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions in particular demonstrate, the
                        Department took seriously its obligation to provide Congress, in a timely
                        manner, the information necessary to exercise appropriate oversight. Indeed,
                        Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions running into hundreds
                        of pages were prepared and submitted to Congress normally within a month of
                        a congressional request, a remarkable performance given the small number of
                        Clerks on staff. The Department made every effort to ensure <hi

                            xml:id="chapter-4fn6">First Assistant Secretaries of State were usually
                            political appointees who developed little expertise; two-thirds only
                            served one or two years.</note> That position rendered him uniquely
                        qualified to determine the contents of the series. From 1866 to 1924, the
                        Department employed only two Second Assistant Secretaries—William Hunter
                        (1866–1886) and Alvey A. Adee (1886–1924). The importance of Hunter and Adee
                        to Departmental operations cannot be overemphasized.<note place="foot" n="7"
                            xml:id="chapter-4fn7"><anchor xml:id="b_94"/>Adee often served as Acting
                            Secretary, especially over the summer months when Department principals
                            and the President frequently left town. Numerous Secretaries of State
                            and Presidents noted their confidence in his abilities. See, for
                            example, Root to Roosevelt, July 2, 1906, LCM, Root Papers, Box 186,
                            Part 2, p. 405. Adee’s handling of difficult issues and international
                            incidents was well-known within the Department. At least one instance,
                            involving a quick-witted démarche concerning Spain in April 1898, was
                            used as a case study in Departmental training materials even decades
                            after his death. See Exhibit 5, Writing Effective Correspondence, M 100
                            course, January 1949 and attached “Adee Biography” materials in NARA, RG

                        enjoyed the confidence of Secretaries and Presidents from both parties, they
                        brought to <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> professional-diplomatic expertise and
                        nonpartisan oversight. A meticulous review of all despatches in the National
                        Archives that were stamped for inclusion in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi>, 1887, together with a representative sampling of
                        redacted correspondence from other years published in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi>, shows that Hunter or Adee marked passages for
                        exclusion. They also assigned despatches to Clerks within the Diplomatic
                        Bureau for action and identified despatches to be omitted from <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>. Hunter normally made changes or
                        identified correspondence for exclusion when reviewing the proof copies of
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. Adee preferred to
                        review the original documents before preparation of page proofs.</p>
                    <p>The task of selecting and compiling correspondence for both <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> and the Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        Submissions fell primarily to Clerks in the Diplomatic Bureau. Rather than
                        mere menials, Clerks served as career officials possessing considerable
                        substantive knowledge. Assigned portfolios according to region and
                        expertise, Diplomatic Bureau Clerks drafted responses to incoming despatches
                        on behalf of Department principals, and they also submitted reports to them
                        on issues of importance. They functioned as the equivalent of today’s
                        Country Desk Officers. Available evidence in the form of marginal
                        annotations to despatches shows that the Diplomatic Bureau Director or a
                        Division Chief reviewed <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> page proofs
                        at some stage in the process. The production process for 19th and early 20th
                        century volumes, then, consisted of high-ranking officials participating
                        directly in the work, complemented by a staff that can be fairly
                        characterized as “professional” with regard to the expertise necessary to
                        compile <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes in their contemporary
                            context.<note place="foot" n="8" xml:id="chapter-4fn8">See, for example,
                            the reports of December 11, 1871 and January 2, 1872 by First Diplomatic
                            Bureau Chief H. D. J. Pratt in NARA, RG 59, Entry A1–745, Reports of the
                            Diplomatic Bureau, 1863–1891, Unbound Material, 1863–1871. The reports
                            outline the transmittal of documents sent to Congress as part of
                            Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions, and then state
                            that only a few were selected for inclusion in the 1871 <hi
                                rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume. The criteria determining how
                            documents were selected is not explained, but the record clearly
                            suggests that careful thought was put into balancing unnecessary
                            duplication with the goal of including key communications necessary to
                            provide a succinct, comprehensive account of events. The Bureau of
                            Archives and Indexes played a coordinative document-tracking role, the
                            editing and publication preparation functions appear to have been
                            divided among one or more bureaus, and the Chief Clerk’s office
                            monitored overall workflow. See also <ref target="#chapter-4fn5"

                        volumes and Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions despite a
                        steadily increasing burden of work. Departmental correspondence during the
                        Civil War more than doubled the volume handled by the Buchanan
                        administration, and the flow did not decrease after 1865. During the first
                        Grant administration the communications traffic increased an additional 17
                        percent. In 1873, the Department received over 20,000 diplomatic
                        communications and sent out more than 19,000 replies. During that year,
                        Congress received 2,122 pages of manuscript records printed in Supplemental
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions. Department staff processed
                        nearly 8,000 additional pages of manuscript to produce the annual <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes covering events for 1873. At that time,
                        the Department employed fewer than 80 people in Washington. Staff shortages
                        perennially plagued the Department as it sought to balance preparation of
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes and responses to

                        Also significant were ministers’ analyses and recommendations. For example,

                        missionaries, Minister to China Frederick F. Low sent Secretary of State

                        officials retained their “personal” correspondence. Today those records are
                        found not in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes or Department
                        records at the National Archives, but rather in collections of personal
                        papers. This leads to a fundamental question regarding the utility of 19th
                        century <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes: how complete a
                        picture did they offer of U.S. foreign policy? Gaillard Hunt, a long-time

                            >FRUS</hi>, wrote in a 1911 history of the Department that “the most

                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>] volumes.”<note place="foot" n="13"

                                International Law</hi> 5 (October 1911), p. 1018. Many subsequent
                            writers have relied on Hunt’s 1911 article, probably because of his
                            reputation as a longstanding Department official and because he later
                            served as the Department’s first official historian several years after
                            he wrote this article. In a single paragraph related to <hi
                                rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, Hunt made a series of statements
                            unsubstantiated by any evidence. Before 1918 Hunt had very little direct
                            experience of the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> process; at the beginning
                            of his career in 1887, he served no more than 18 months in the Bureau of
                            Indexes and Archives, the unit partially responsible for producing <hi
                                rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> and Supplemental <hi
                                rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions to Congress. Between 1888 and
                            his departure for the Library of Congress in 1909, Hunt was assigned to
                            Bureaus responsible for statistics, pardons and commissions, consular
                            affairs, and accounts. He became Chief of the Passport Bureau in 1902
                            and Chief of the Citizenship Bureau in 1907. None of those units played
                            a significant role in compiling or editing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>.
                            Hunt claimed that the series was “often delayed for reasons of policy”
                            even though at the time of his 1911 writing 55 volumes had been
                            published within a year and only 9 volumes could be considered late. The
                            tardy volumes included the most recent six covering 1906–1909, but Hunt
                            did not cite Departmental or public records indicating that
                            congressional parsimony caused the delays. See especially Charles
                            Denby’s testimony in Hearings, Sundry Civil Appropriation Bill for 1908,
                            59th Cong., 2nd Sess., House, Committee on Appropriations, January 05,
                            1907, pp. 839–845 and the citations regarding heightened strictures on
                            federal printing discussed in <ref target="#chapter-5">chapter 5</ref>.
                            Hunt also stated, “In printing the diplomatic correspondence it is
                            freely edited, only that portion, the publicity of which can not disturb
                            the diplomatic relations of the United States, being given out.” Hunt
                            provided no examples of what he meant by “freely edited” nor did he
                            define what criteria Departmental officials used to determine how a
                            passage might disturb diplomatic relations. Moreover, Hunt averred that
                            “The most interesting correspondence does not appear in the volumes,”
                            but again cited no comparative examples. Finally, Hunt made no reference
                            to the substantial additional releases to Congress embodied in the
                            Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions discussed here and

                        early 20th century releases, Department officials sometimes excised portions
                        of correspondence before publication. Usually, the Second Assistant
                        Secretary of State edited the diplomatic correspondence. Hunter and his
                        successor Adee removed passages appearing in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> if the information fell into one of several categories
                        similar to those first outlined by Edmund Randolph in 1794.<note

                                >chapter 1</ref> above. To assess this practice, Peter Cozzens
                            examined the originals of two to three despatches with significant
                            excisions in their published form for each year from 1870 to 1897. No
                            clear pattern emerged.</note> The most frequently excised passages were
                        inflammatory in nature, or critical of the Department or U.S. government
                        officials, or revealed sensitive foreign sources. Rather than employing
                        exactly-defined criteria, it appears that Hunter and Adee excised material
                        as they deemed appropriate based on their appreciation of the subject matter
                        and the context. Illustrative examples of excised despatches appearing in

                            <anchor xml:id="b_777"/>In an 1886 paragraph withheld from a report on
                            discriminatory petroleum regulations in Austria-Hungary and hopes for a
                            more favorable treaty, Chargé d’Affaires James F. Lee questioned the
                            integrity of his predecessor. “Our trade in petroleum has naturally
                            steadily declined. Not from any want of proper attention to its
                            interests (as implied in recent publications in the United States) by
                            those representing the Department of State at present in this monarchy,”
                            he assured Secretary Bayard. “It is surprising to learn that other
                            administrations have, through the friendly personal relations of their
                            representatives, prevented some mythical hostile legislation. The truth
                            is there has been no legislation and none proposed during the last ten
                            years.” Also excised were references to Lee’s secret dealings with
                            Standard Oil to improve the company’s position in the Austro-Hungarian
                            market and with Bohemian Clubs to encourage them to speak out against
                            the imperial policy.<note place="foot" n="26" xml:id="chapter-4fn26"

                        Russell after the publication of a despatch critical of the Venezuelan
                        government certainly provided Hunter and Adee with a cautionary precedent
                        for excising inflammatory remarks that served no policy interests. In 1866
                        the United States and Venezuela agreed to submit claims of American citizens
                        against the South American country to a mixed commission for arbitration.
                        Nine years later, the commission had yet to render judgment in all the
                        cases. Those funds it had awarded to Americans remained locked in the
                        Venezuelan treasury, the government unwilling to release them. On May 8,
                        1875, an exasperated Minister Russell told Secretary Fish that there were,
                        in his opinion, “only two ways in which the payment of so large an amount
                        can be obtained. The first is by sharing the proceeds with some of the chief
                        officers of this government; the second, by a display of force, or, at
                        least, a threat of force. The first course, which has been pursued by one or
                        more nations, will of course never be followed by the United States. The

                        Government became aware of the message in January 1877, Foreign Minister
                        Caleano told Russell to pack his bags. The statements in Russell’s May 1875
                        despatch, the foreign minister wrote, represented “a most violent attack
                        because they insult the administration most grievously, besides involving a
                        notorious falsehood.” Secretary of State Thomas Evarts rushed to Russell’s
                        defense. On April 2, 1877, he sent Venezuelan Minister to the United States
                        Dalla Costa a note stating that if the Venezuelan Government did not
                        communicate a satisfactory explanation for the “abrupt and extraordinary
                        step” of expelling Russell, Dalla Costa would also be sent home. Although
                        Caracas formally withdrew its statement in July, Russell remained <hi

                        potential Venezuelan reaction to Russell’s uncomplimentary despatch, or he
                        decided that it failed to meet the “not in the public interest” threshold
                        for withholding correspondence from Congress. Had Hunter deemed the despatch
                        sufficiently important to share with Congress, but too sensitive for public
                        consumption, he might have taken an alternative course—submit the despatch
                        confidentially. As had been the case since the Early Republic, occasionally
                        the Department provided Congress diplomatic correspondence with the
                        understanding that the documents would be treated as confidential and not
                        published. Normally this procedure was reserved for correspondence
                        pertaining to treaty negotiations. Congress printed the correspondence as
                        lettered, rather than the usual numbered Executive Documents, and marked
                        them “Confidential.” In every other respect the printed documents resembled

                        diplomats abroad. For example, from the legations in China and Japan came
                        complaints that the English-language press in those countries—newspapers
                        that British interests controlled—used published despatches to bludgeon both
                        the ministers and American policy. In August 1872, the U.S. Minister to
                        Japan Frederick F. Low reported with annoyance and perplexity the mixed
                        reaction of <hi rend="italic">The Shanghai Courier</hi>, a British-run
                        newspaper, to despatches concerning China in <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        Similarly, the U.S. Minister to Japan, John A. Bingham, lamented the regular
                        criticism of American policy toward Japan by English journalists in that
                            country.<note place="foot" n="33" xml:id="chapter-4fn33">Bingham to

                        cost of doing business. Low attributed the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>’s
                        somewhat hostile commentary to his unmasking of the evils of the opium
                        trade, in which British merchants, with government support, were
                        conspicuously engaged. But, he told Fish, “at the risk of incurring the
                        displeasure of the local press I shall continue to prosecute my
                        investigation with reference to the internal economy of this country, the

                        be given to the Department.” Low did not ask that the Department refrain
                        from including such reports in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, but
                        his reassurances about continued straightforward reporting identified a key
                        risk to excessive transparency: the central purpose of sending diplomats
                        abroad would be defeated if they did not feel “safe” to provide honest
                        accounts and incisive assessments.<note place="foot" n="34"

                        altogether. Echoing the sentiments expressed by security guardians since the
                        inception of the series, in 1907 Third Assistant Secretary of State
                        Huntington Wilson opposed “rushing into print with the prompt publication of
                        our diplomatic business” because “the effect of the publication of <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> is to show our hand to our
                        competitors and to place in their hands arguments to be, in turn, used by

                        Opponents of significant documentary releases often proposed substitute
                        arrangements that would have fundamentally altered the character of the
                        established U.S. transparency regime. Wilson, for example, wanted to
                        discontinue <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> in favor of occasional papers on
                        discrete subjects or concluded negotiations, produced primarily for
                        confidential dissemination to the Senate and diplomatic posts abroad.
                        Revealing his approach to public affairs, Wilson suggested, “those of these
                        papers which might be found useful to inform and mould public opinion and
                        which were still innocuous could be given to the press at opportune

                        practice of releasing recent foreign policy documents. In the 19th and early
                        20th centuries, the Department of State lacked clear, consistent information
                        security policies to control the protection and release of documents. This
                        led to skirmishes between Department principals and ministers at overseas
                        posts reluctant to express themselves freely for fear that their words might
                        appear in public.</p>

                        press reprinted with angry commentary, a despatch he had written in May 1883
                        on the contentious issue of American pork exports, Minister A. A. Sargent
                        told Washington that he would desist from reporting honestly. That angered
                        First Assistant Secretary J. C. Bancroft Davis. Second Assistant Secretary
                        of State Adee, a career civil servant widely respected in Congress for his
                        nonpartisanship, crafted a carefully worded rebuke for Davis’s signature. In
                        view of Adee’s impeccable credentials and long service, and the 13 years
                        that Davis logged under two administrations, the letter of instruction is
                        reprinted as the best postbellum expression of Department policy. As Davis
                        explained to Sargent: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The Department gives to the consideration and preparation for
                                publication of the despatches of its agents abroad every attention
                                with the object of guarding against the publication of their
                                personal views which might, if known, expose them to criticism or
                                censure in the land of their official residence. On an examination
                                of the Blue Books of other governments, it is believed that far more
                                care is here exercised in this respect than in other countries. . .
                                .</p>
                            <p>Your intimation that the effect of the publication of despatches of
                                this character is that a Minister, situated in the midst of jealous
                                influences, cannot venture to speak freely in criticism or even
                                explanation of measures aimed at his government is, it is conceived,
                                an extreme conclusion to be drawn from the premises, if it
                                represents your opinion that such matters are not expedient to be
                                included in despatches which the interests of the government require
                                to be made public in whole or part. As you justly observe: “To send
                                such information in such colorless form that, if it were published,
                                the government to which the Minister is accredited could not find a
                                shade of criticism, or matter of exception, and yet the Department
                                get from it a true picture of occurrences having inimical
                                tendencies, and of which it should be expressly warned, would seem
                                impossible.” The Department explicitly invites and confidently
                                expects that its agents abroad will transmit just such matters in
                                their official correspondence, and it would hold the omission to do
                                so an unfortunate caution.</p>
                            <p>If the propriety of making such matters public in due time be left to
                                the discretion of the Secretary of State, it is indeed possible that
                                his views as to what parts of such communications may or may not be
                                obnoxious to adverse criticism may differ from those of the writer.
                                The latter being brought into direct contact with the foreign
                                adverse elements surrounding him, is naturally often better
                                qualified to judge of what may be liable to be used by unfair
                                partizanship [sic] to his discredit. Fully aware of this, the
                                Department always gives the most considerate attention to any
                                intimation its agents may convey that their despatches are to be
                                deemed confidential, and it rarely happens that public interests are
                                so grave as to override such intimations.</p>
                            <p>I have to suggest therefore that whenever, in your judgment, the
                                information you communicate to your government is of a character to
                                demand reserve, it be either embraced in a separate despatch, marked
                                    “<hi rend="underline">confidential</hi>” and confined to that
                                subject alone, or that, in event of your deeming any isolated
                                paragraphs of an otherwise public despatch proper to be withheld
                                from publication, you bracket them with a red line and mark them

                        Secretary of State John W. Foster invoked Davis’s stratagem to preempt
                        possible publication of sensitive correspondence from U.S. Minister to
                        Hawaii John L. Stevens. Like Davis, Foster told Stevens that he should
                        separate despatches into “two classes, one of which shall aim to give the
                        narrative of public affairs in their open historical aspect, and the other
                        to be of a strictly reserved and confidential character reporting and
                        commenting upon matters of personal intrigue and the like so far as you may
                        deem necessary for my full understanding of the situation.” Too many of
                        Stevens’ despatches, observed Foster, “combine these two modes of treatment
                        to such a degree as to make their publication in the event of a call from
                        Congress or other occasion therefore, inexpedient and, indeed,
                        impracticable, without extended omissions.”<note place="foot" n="38"

                        believe his own instructions. In January 1893, Congress requested
                        correspondence relating to the 1854 Treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii, with
                        the usual “if not inconsistent with the public interest” caveat. Foster
                        interpreted Congress’s intent liberally and provided documents covering the
                        half century from 1843 to 1893. Among them were two despatches from Stevens,
                        clearly marked “Confidential,” about personal intrigue in the court of Queen
                        Liliuokalani. Both predated but were in accordance with Foster’s November
                        letter of instruction. In his submission of documents to Congress, Foster
                        omitted his letter of instruction; apparently the public interest was not
                        served by its implication that Foster hoped to evade close congressional
                        scrutiny of the Harrison administration’s Hawaii policy.<note place="foot"

                        despatches, this time with Foster’s November 1892 cautionary instructions.
                        There is no indication that anyone in Congress took note of Foster’s earlier

                        Johns Hopkins University and Cornell University on American statecraft,
                        former U.S. Minister to Greece Eugene Schuyler voiced an argument that
                        typified the position of security guardians in a 19th century setting.<note

                        utility of split correspondence or red-inked despatches and warned of the
                        impact of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series on frank
                        reporting. “Even with all the care that can be exercised despatches are not
                        infrequently published which get their writers in trouble,” wrote Schuyler.
                        As a consequence, “our ministers do not feel free to express to the
                        Secretary their real opinions; for they have always in view the possibility
                        that their despatches may be published. . . . Even confidential letters do
                        not always tell the whole truth.” Schuyler proposed to scrap the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, contending that “it would
                        be wrong to print, simply for the general information of the public,
                        anything more than . . . routine despatches.” Better, he thought, to wait
                        until Congress asked for information on special subjects. “Even then,”
                        Schuyler added, “great caution should be observed [because] foreign
                        governments sometimes make confidential communications, and in such cases it
                        would be improper to print these communications without the consent of those

                        narrow. First of all, no U.S.-originated documents required publication
                        approval from abroad. Hamilton Fish made this clear to Horace Maynard, U.S.

                        encroachment of European powers, particularly France, upon Constantinople’s
                        indirect sovereignty over Tripolitania and Tunis made this suggestion that
                        they were independent nations particularly irksome to the Turks. “The fact
                        that the volume to which he referred,” Fish told Maynard, “was a
                        communication by the President to Congress and not one addressed to foreign
                        governments (although we furnish them with copies of this, as we do of all
                        or nearly all of our public documents),” and “that the arrangement to which
                        he had referred was not intended to convey any special political
                        significance, but was one of usage and domestic convenience; that we do
                        regard both Tunis and Tripoli as Barbary States; that they are so regarded
                        and spoken of by geographers, historians, and lexicographers; that we have
                        separate and independent treaties with each of them, for the execution and
                        observance of which we hold them responsible.”<note place="foot" n="43"

                            least partly an instrument of public diplomacy.</note>

                        required specific agreement in advance. In a letter of instruction to U.S.
                        Minister to Mexico Philip Morgan in 1883, Secretary Frederick Frelinghuysen
                        reiterated the Department’s view that other governments had no voice in
                        determining contents of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                        “In the absence of any express reserve or pledge of confidence asked and
                        given, correspondence between governments is the property of either,”
                        Frelinghuysen averred, “to be published if the interests of either require.
                        This government in common with most other governments publishes so much of
                        its diplomatic correspondence to be required for the information of the
                        national legislature and the people. It is thought quite immaterial on which
                        side the correspondence may have been initiated, questions of public utility
                        alone being sufficient to decide the time and the extent of publicity to be
                        given to it.”<note place="foot" n="44" xml:id="chapter-4fn44">Frederick

                        confidential communications and defining the limits to foreign government
                        equities in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series appears to
                        have been constant through the early 20th century, actual practices could
                        vary considerably. The episodes related throughout <ref target="#part-1"
                            >Part One</ref> of this book demonstrate the absence from one
                        Presidential administration to another (and sometimes even during the course
                        of a single Secretary’s tenure) of clearly understood or uniformly applied
                        policies defining the universe of diplomatic correspondence open to public
                        submission to Congress or publication in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi>. As a consequence of this lack of policy clarity, in
                        order to prevent the publication of sensitive despatches, ministers employed
                        a variety of informal designators. Because “Confidential” despatches
                        frequently appeared in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, they used
                        labels such as “Confidential and Secret,” “Personal and Secret,” “Private
                        and Confidential,” and “Personal and Private” to safeguard despatches from
                        release. Documents marked as “personal” or “private” generally did not
                        appear in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> or in Supplemental <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions to Congress. Their absence seems to
                        represent a gentleman’s agreement within the Department that the airing of
                        such correspondence was not in the public interest. Many such despatches
                        were never entered into the regular recordkeeping mechanisms of the
                        Department. Essentially, Department officers were struggling toward a
                        concept that is embodied today in the Departmental handling designations
                        such as NODIS (No Distribution), which restricts the dissemination of highly
                        sensitive communications to the Chief of Mission at post, the Secretary of
                        State, and the President (express permission is required to share such
                        documents more broadly).<note place="foot" n="45" xml:id="chapter-4fn45">See

                        required redaction could not be simplified to a formula. In 1900, John
                        Bassett Moore stated, “I am not aware of any precise rule on which one could
                        rely.” The decisionmaking process involved “a question of judgment and

                        deciding, collectively, what information could be divulged without prejudice
                        to “the public interest.” Although usually only an irritant in its 19th and
                        early 20th century context, this aspect of publishing foreign policy
                        documents rose to a much greater level of significance after 1914.<anchor

                            Department provided essential documents to Congress without the need for
                            legislative pressure. Frequent submissions of diplomatic correspondence

                            Submissions normally addressed foreign policy matters of greatest

                            than the annual volumes. Most of the press coverage of the annual
                            volumes consisted of short notices and often succinct summaries of a few

                            <p>The government of the United States occasionally prints documents
                                illustrating our relations with the Governments of foreign powers.
                                Sometimes these documents are printed in pursuance of a call of the
                                Senate or the House for information on some special topic. Thus, an
                                honorable Senator or Representative wants to know all about the . .
                                . correspondence which has passed between [Great Britain and the
                                United States] about Fenianism. So he gets through a resolution
                                calling on the President, “if not incompatible with the public
                                interest,” for the coveted information. The resolution is duly
                                engrossed in red tape and sent up to the White House. Thence, after
                                being invested with more red tape, it is referred to the Department
                                of State. Straightaway, a corps of department clerks is set to work
                                to copy the correspondence and other documents desired. These copies
                                . . . are enveloped in red tape and consigned to the President, by
                                whose direction they receive another string of red tape and are
                                dispatched to Congress. Arrived there, they are announced as “a
                                message from the President of the United States” and (usually)
                                referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be
                                printed. Another member, perhaps, is anxious on the subject of the
                                Chinese immigration, or the Greek brigands, or free ocean cables, or
                                our trade with South America, or claims upon Mexico, or any other
                                topic that may involve correspondence or negotiations with foreign
                                powers. So he pops through his resolution calling for the documents,
                                and, when communicated, they are in nine cases out of ten printed,
                                even though not one American citizen in ten thousand has the
                                smallest interest in the question.</p>

                                documents, there is printed every year a regular volume or volumes
                                consisting of documents on the foreign relations of the United
                                States and sent to Congress with the annual message of the
                                President. . . . These ponderous issues commenced in 1861, and were
                                kept up, continually growing in volume, until Mr. Seward was, much
                                to his regret, relieved from the cares of office in 1869. . . . At
                                length [Seward] laid down the official stylus and gave place to a
                                less voluminous successor. Mr. Hamilton Fish has what is commonly
                                charged to be a leading characteristic of President Grant . . .
                                occasional “flashes of silence.” So we find our diplomatic
                                correspondence again compressed into reasonable if not altogether

                                indexed. It opens with papers relating to the Franco-Prussian War,
                                and this very fruitful theme absorbs . . . nearly one-half the
                                volume. The perusal of it tends to enhance our opinion of the
                                efficiency and discretion of our present minister in Paris, Mr. E.
                                B. Washburne . . . Under the most difficult and trying
                                circumstances, [Washburne and the legation staff] stood at their
                                posts after the representatives of nearly every other nation had
                                left, and our Minister was the means of succor and defense not only
                                to all Americans, but to the friendless subjects of many European
                                Powers.</p>

                        confidentially should have been retained within the Department for at least
                        a few years. Yet even such cases, the “expiration date” on most
                        sensitive-restricted material would be considered quite short by modern

                        the Department’s operations and representatives, causing readers to draw
                        conclusions about both the nation’s policies and the competence of those who
                        carried it out. The 1870 volume featured a rebuke of the highly capable
                        Minister to China, Frederick F. Low, by Secretary Fish for failing to convey
                        United States policy accurately to the Chinese government. In the wake of
                        the Tientsin massacre, the condition of American missionaries in China was
                        the subject of vigorous press debate. The Department probably included the
                        rebuke in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> to assure the American

                        “express a manifest contempt for style.” The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>
                        called attention to an exchange between Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham
                        and the U.S. Minister to Bolivia Thomas Moonlight to illustrate the
                        unfamiliarity of many ministers with the basic rules of diplomacy. Moonlight
                        had asked Bolivian authorities to promote a Bolivian army officer for
                        “courtesies and kindnesses” he had extended Moonlight since the minister’s
                        arrival in La Paz. Gresham hastened to remind him that, “however usual such
                        a proceeding may be in Bolivia,” it was against U.S. statutes and Department
                        regulations for an American diplomat to advocate for the advancement of a
                        foreign official. The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> also took note of a

                        commend American diplomacy. Assistant Secretary of State J. C. Bancroft
                        Davis mailed copies of the 1870 volume to colleagues and friends in states
                        in which he had business interests. Benjamin Moran wrote from London, “I
                        much like your new publication. The title—Foreign Relations—is legitimate
                        and the volume is wisely arranged. It contains just what we want to know,
                        and the Alphabetical Index is both novel and extremely useful. Please send
                        me some more copies.” After his “first dash at it,” Alexander Hamilton, Jr.
                        said he found the volume “very interesting.” Eminent New York City attorney
                        James W. Gerard, Jr. also thought <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>,
                        1870 worthwhile. “I will peruse it with much gratification,” wrote Gerard,
                        “and will find it very serviceable in my library for purposes of reference.”
                        Massachusetts attorney William S. Richardson eagerly awaited the tome. “I
                        believe in your department,” Richardson told Davis,” and I have done what
                        few people outside of your office have undertaken. I have read nearly all
                        the volumes and I shall read this one.”<note place="foot" n="66"

                        disastrously embroiled in the muddled multilateral diplomacy surrounding the

                            went to war with Peru and Bolivia in 1879 over contested territory rich
                            in sodium nitrate and guano, Europe’s fertilizers of choice. The Chilean
                            army rolled up Bolivian and Peruvian forces over the next two years,
                            occupying Lima in early 1881. The Chilean navy also soundly defeated the
                            Peruvian navy, giving it uncontested control of coastal waters. For

                        between remnants of the Peruvian army and Chilean occupation forces. Blaine
                        believed stability in Latin America comprised the necessary precondition for
                        enhanced U.S. trade opportunities in the region, and he decried the
                        continued hostilities as an opportunity for European intervention in South

                        Kilpatrick to admonish Santiago not to make unreasonable demands on Peru. He
                        told Minister to Peru Stephen A. Hurlbut to encourage the Peruvians to
                        accept any “reasonable conditions and limitations” necessary to facilitate
                        Chilean recognition of the Peruvian provisional government and bring an end
                        to the fighting.</p>
                    <p>Neither diplomat followed Blaine’s orders. Hurlbut sided openly with Peru,
                        urged the U.S. government to intervene to prevent Chile from carving up the
                        country, and negotiated an agreement with the provisional Peruvian
                        Government for a U.S. naval coaling station. Kilpatrick openly espoused
                        Chile’s cause and disputed publicly with Hurlbut, fervently criticizing his
                        actions. Moreover, Hurlbut became entangled in the dubious machinations of
                        several private companies’ claims to contested Peruvian nitrate and guano
                        deposits (located in Chilean-occupied territory). Some of the claimants had
                        political connections in Washington, lending credence to the appearance that
                        Blaine and Hurlbut could be pursuing “guano diplomacy” to save Peruvian
                        territory from Chile for the benefit of private business interests in which
                        they might have a stake.<note place="foot" n="75" xml:id="chapter-4fn75">

                        <anchor xml:id="b_623"/>Blaine neglected to rein in his ministers in a
                        timely manner. The July 2, 1881 attack on President James A. Garfield, after
                        which he lingered for 11 weeks before dying, threw the Cabinet into
                        disarray. Few instructions of any sort emanated from the Department for
                        nearly three months, and after Garfield died on September 19, an ill and
                        exhausted Blaine departed for an extended vacation in Maine. He returned in
                        mid-November to galvanizing developments. Blaine learned that President
                        Chester A. Arthur intended to replace him with Frederick Frelinghuysen,
                        pending confirmation when Congress reconvened in December. Newspapers had
                        begun to ridicule the Secretary for his inattention to Hurlbut’s rogue
                        diplomacy and to the unseemly duel between Hurlbut and Kilpatrick.<note

                        hastened to rescue his position and protect his longer-term reputation by
                        manipulating the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. He had not
                        yet written his errant ministers; if made public, the record would show
                        three months of silence on his part. Because the cut-off date had already

                        For the first time since 1869, there would be no annual submission of

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_624"/>Blaine’s public relations-oriented strategy only made
                        his situation worse. He hurriedly wrote the two ministers, upbraiding them
                        for failing to follow his instructions, chiding them for undiplomatic
                        behavior, and downplaying the impression that he had favored one of the
                        competing claimants in the mineral deposits dispute. At the same time Blaine
                        withheld the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume, he doled out select
                        documents to the press himself. The suspect timing of those releases and the
                        self-serving nature of the documents only exacerbated criticisms about
                        Blaine’s judgment and his ministers’ competence. Both Houses of Congress
                        called for all Department correspondence on the War of the Pacific. On
                        December 19, 1881, President Arthur removed Blaine in favor of
                            Frelinghuysen.<note place="foot" n="78" xml:id="chapter-4fn78">

                        to distance the Department from Blaine’s actions and avoid scandal,
                        Frelinghuysen released everything, including very recent confidential
                        reports that torpedoed the efforts of an American special envoy sent in
                        December to broker peace between Chile and Peru. The issue of whether U.S.
                        representatives overseas could report with candor, and the related question
                        of what information could be appropriately divulged publicly, reappeared in
                        the press. The Department and the Congress launched investigations to
                        determine whether any anyone had engaged in improper actions to involve the
                        U.S. government in business transactions with regard to the guano claims
                        cases. Although the inquests produced no charges, the impression remained
                        that Blaine had sought to manipulate the outcome of the war for personal
                            gain.<note place="foot" n="80" xml:id="chapter-4fn80">Fish to Davis,

                    <p>The Blaine affair raised again fundamental questions that troubled diplomats
                        throughout the era. Would their despatches be manipulated for partisan
                        purposes, or would certain sensitive communications find their way into
                        print? And what might such revelations mean for their relations with the
                        host government and for their own careers? American ministers abroad
                        sometimes protested the release of documents, and it is probably true that
                        episodes such as this dampened honest reporting from the field for a time.
                        Yet even these most directly interested officials, with rare exceptions,
                        continued to support the value of government accountability to its
                            constituents.<note place="foot" n="82" xml:id="chapter-4fn82">See, for

                    <p>The Blaine imbroglio demonstrated that politicians who violated the (largely
                        implicit) “<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compact” did so at great risk.
                        Blaine’s attempt to manipulate the timing and content of the 1881 volume
                        backfired because members of both political parties, as well as the press,
                        expected the series to remain above partisan infighting or personal
                        interest. Foreign policy documents created by government officials were
                        records “owned” by the public and not to be withheld, or even delayed,
                        without very good reason. Knowledgeable observers recognized that exceptions
                        might be necessary to protect the national interest, but the presumption
                        remained that any communication was liable to become part of the public
                        record as a consequence of the executive branch’s responsibility to inform
                        the people’s representatives in Congress. Blaine, therefore, violated the
                        compact on several counts. He delayed publication of the 1881 volume in
                        order to redress his own deficiency in the formulation of policy. That the
                        President’s appointed ministers exceeded or ignored their instructions only
                        highlighted Blaine’s lack of supervision over the nation’s representatives
                        abroad. Even the mere implication that the Department of State might engage
                        in favoritism, or that high officials pursued personal gain instead of
                        promoting the people’s business, constituted a potentially serious blow to
                        the integrity of the government. Yet the rarity of such occurrences
                        indicates that all parties respected the unofficial compact. Americans
                        generally believed that transparency played a critical role in the proper
                        operation of a republic, and <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> represented an

                        delay; neither press nor Congress complained to any noticeable degree. Some
                        sources have been read to suggest that the McKinley administration
                        deliberately withheld sensitive information about U.S. actions surrounding

                            was made to delay the 1898 volume. The limitations of Hunt’s account are
                            discussed in <ref target="#chapter-4fn13">note 13</ref>, above. In a
                            single unsourced sentence on page 33, Michael states, “In any case, the
                            objective of the collection cannot have been the complete reproduction
                            of the documents since, shortly after the turn of the century, the
                            ranking official in charge remarked candidly that the files ‘are given
                            in part.’” This chapter demonstrates that high-ranking officials
                            regularly participated in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> production,
                            particularly the selection and redaction process. All parties understood
                            that on occasion the executive branch would withhold information from
                            the limited categories discussed in previous chapters, so Michael’s
                            remark about documents “given in part” represented a routine statement
                            of well-known practice rather than a revelatory admission of conspiracy
                            to defraud. This section also suggests that a principal reason for the
                            delay of the 1898 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> was Michael’s own failure
                            to manage the volume’s production. Tyler Dennett, “Office of the

                                Journal</hi> VI, no. 9 (September 1929): p. 295, does not discuss
                            the tardy release of the 1898 volume but incorrectly states that John
                            Bassett Moore became Assistant Secretary of State after his return from
                            the peace conference. Dennett also incorrectly credits Moore with
                            editing the 1898 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, as do other
                            accounts.</note> If that were an accurate depiction of the delay, it
                        would represent an important milestone in the degradation of transparency
                        expectations developed over the previous century: at the moment the United
                        States arrived on the world stage as a Great Power by exerting force across
                        two oceans and acquiring overseas territory, the executive branch withheld
                        foreign policy documents from Congress and the public. Had that been the
                        case, it could be argued that the 1898 volume established a precedent for
                        expanding national security exceptions to the rapid release of information.
                        A careful examination of the extant record, however, reveals that the
                        established practices of responsible release continued to operate through
                        the crisis of war and its aftermath. The President and the Department did
                        share important information with the Senate in a timely manner. An
                        unfortunate constellation of personnel changes, reassignments, and
                        administrative reorganization caused the tardy appearance of the 1898
                        volume, which in turn delayed the 1899 and 1900 volumes. With the release of
                        the 1901 volume, the series returned to the contemporaneous release
                        practices established in 1861.</p>

                        In the two years before war erupted, the Department transmitted over 450
                        documents totaling more than 650 pages to Congress in Supplemental <hi

                        ordinary. As had been the case for a century, a general understanding
                        maintained between the executive and legislative branches that certain

                        series of alterations in the responsibilities of key U.S. government
                        personnel derailed <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> production. In September
                        William R. Day resigned his position as Secretary of State (which he held
                        for only five months) to head the American peace negotiation delegation.
                        McKinley named John Hay as his third Secretary of State during 1898, which

                        Secretary of State John Bassett Moore also resigned to serve as the Peace
                        Commission’s secretary and legal adviser. When the negotiations concluded on
                        December 10, 1899, Day did not return to the Department, and Moore did so

                        Michael had served as Chief Clerk only since May 1897, and therefore had
                        little experience of the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> process. Day assumed
                        that Moore had worked on the volume’s contents, but Moore left that task to
                        Michael. Either owing to overwork or lack of interest, Michael apparently
                        did little to direct the compilation process.<note place="foot" n="92"

                        unique opportunity to release more documents. The discussion that ensued
                        among current and former high government officials illustrates the general
                        commitment to openness typical of the Contemporaneous <hi rend="italic"

                        redaction decisions. Although no longer Department officers, Day and Moore
                        advocated with Adee and McKinley to include more material than would have
                        been releasable two years earlier. Because the common understanding of the
                        era held that U.S. Government representatives engaging in diplomatic
                        correspondence should be consulted when determining the disposition of the
                        records they created, Day persuaded Adee to “clear” still-closed negotiation
                        records with the members of the American peace delegation.<note place="foot"

                        passed; with the peace treaty approved by both governments, no major harm
                        would come from printing the negotiation records.<note place="foot" n="97"

                            1896–1900. The context of Moore’s remark indicates he did not refer
                            primarily to a large number of additional documents releasable two years
                            later than normal, but rather to the type of document categories that

                        categories of information must remain protected; for example, Day noted that
                        “the parts referring to other governments and interviews with ministers of

                    <p>The records concerning the 1898 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> convey a sense of
                        how key government officials treated document handling, the factors weighed
                        in “declassification” decisions, and the procedures for release of
                        information. The lack of clear definition of what would now be designated
                        “classified” documents, and the permeable border between personal records
                        and those belonging to the government may seem curious to modern eyes. Yet
                        few governments at that time had developed standardized, organized
                        life-cycle polices for records retention, indexing, retrieval, retirement,
                        and archival preservation—to say nothing of declassification and release.
                        Within the U.S. Government, the senders and recipients of communications
                        played the key roles in determining how to file for later use, and whether
                        to disseminate, special correspondence in restricted communications
                        categories such as “personal” or “confidential.<note place="foot" n="100"

                        other instances as well, the principals adopted a pragmatic approach. This
                        subjective approach to whether to withhold a specific piece of information
                        from a particular document nevertheless involved corporate decisionmaking;
                        in addition to the compilers, Department officials at the Assistant
                        Secretary and Secretary level, and sometimes the President, conferred about
                        what material to release. When they did excise documents, compilers and
                        reviewers took great care to identify the lacunae with ellipses, asterisks,
                        dashes, or similar markings. The timeliness element also figured in release
                        determinations; those responsible for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> clearly
                        believed that additional, qualitatively different, sorts of information
                        could, and should, be divulged two years after the original submissions to
                        the Senate. An informal but nevertheless efficacious type of
                        extra-Departmental clearance procedure existed; the peace commissioners all
                        agreed to release the record of their endeavors, and the Senate only voted
                        to remove injunctions of secrecy when overtaken by events.<note place="foot"

                            the January 4, 1899 submission, selective leaks to the press mitigated
                            in favor of making the whole record public immediately. The Senate only
                            voted to publish the January 30, 1899 documents in February 1901, after
                            it became general knowledge on Capitol Hill that the 1898 <hi

                        the example of the 1898 volume indicates that while key decisionmakers
                        applied limited exceptions to assure that information was not released
                        irresponsibly, the default policy governing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        prescribed openness whenever feasible.<anchor xml:id="b_1356-end"

                    <p>For nearly a half-century, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        series and its Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions
                        performed both practical and symbolic functions. The Department of State
                        routinely produced diplomatic correspondence—of very recent vintage—on
                        demand, and then bundled the remaining important papers into one or more
                        volumes at years’ end. Along with the Congress, executive branch principals,
                        including Assistant Secretaries and Secretaries of State as well as the
                        President, shared a common commitment to provide the American people as much
                        of the record as they could responsibly release. Congress considered the
                        correspondence vital to their oversight function. Newspapers that supported
                        the current administration’s efforts could cite praiseworthy evidence from
                        the records, while detractors highlighted documents they believed
                        illustrated defects in policy. Foreign observers mined the volumes for
                        insight and information. <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> facilitated routine
                        Departmental business, enabled “messaging” aimed at domestic and
                        international audiences, and presented enticing—if risky—opportunities for
                        diplomatic or partisan maneuvering. Diplomats wrestled with the double-edged
                        nature of seeing their missives in print soon after their transmission to
                        Washington. On the one hand, public revelation of their assessments and
                        activities could yield benefits to the nation as a whole, and perhaps for
                        their individual careers as well. Conversely, untimely release could damage
                        both current relations and their future prospects. The documents proved
                        integral to the interchange between the executive and legislative branches,
                        as well as to the wider public discourse about key foreign policy issues of
                        the day. The <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> process constituted a demonstrable
                        expression of popular sovereignty for the nation and the world by serving as
                        a mechanism for accountability. As the publication of foreign policy records
                        fell behind current events in subsequent decades, <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> stakeholders struggled to reinterpret the values exemplified

                    <p>The period between 1905 and the mid-1920s represents a crucial transitional
                        period in the history of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> because significant
                        publication delays became a fundamental issue facing the series. Beginning
                        with the two 1906 volumes, which were not published until 1909, <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> never again appeared within a year
                        of the events covered. <ref target="#appendix-a">Appendices A</ref> and <ref

                        arose, especially after World War I erupted in 1914. The initial reason for
                        this delay did not stem from a desire of U.S. officials to withhold
                        information from the public, nor because foreign governments intervened to
                        prevent their records from being published. <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> fell
                        behind its original standard of near-contemporaneous release because of
                        inadequate funding; Congress did not supply the Department with
                        appropriations sufficient to compile, edit, and publish the volumes in a

                        beginning in 1906, changes in U.S. Government printing policy triggered the

                        for the President and Congress, receiving in return a

                        from their own appropriations.<note place="foot" n="1" xml:id="chapter-5fn1"
                            >“The usual number” varied depending on the type of publication, and
                            that number might change over time, but Congress usually provided
                            agencies between 1,000 and 2,000 copies of their own annual reports. See
                            also Tyler Dennett, “Office of the Historical Adviser,” p. 295.</note>
                        The Department of State, however, produced no annual report; <hi

                        Department paid for its own copies, which explains why, over time, a common
                        cost-saving measure involved purchasing fewer <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> volumes than the number allotted by Congress. By the
                        early 1900s, the Department ordered only 500–600 copies of each volume, as
                        little as one-quarter of the number purchased in the post-Civil War era and
                        less than half the number allowed by the statute of 1895 (see <ref
                            target="#appendix-b">appendix B</ref>). Shortages of older volumes had
                        already become problematic; by 1905 the Department could not even provide
                        full series sets for newly-appointed Secretaries of State because “several
                        volumes are no longer procurable anywhere.”<note place="foot" n="2"

                        in a long series of congressional attempts to control printing costs. In
                        March 1905, Congress created a Printing Investigation Commission charged
                        with reducing federal publishing to save money and reduce waste. Before the
                        Commission had even issued its preliminary report a year later, publishing
                        limitation had become a major issue for the executive branch. In January
                        1906, President Theodore Roosevelt directed agencies to reduce all
                        unnecessary printing of government publications, including, “to prevent the
                        printing of the maximum edition allowed by law, when a smaller edition will
                        suffice.” Shortly thereafter Root created a Department committee that
                        required all future requisitions for printing to be submitted to the Chief
                            Clerk.<note place="foot" n="5" xml:id="chapter-5fn5">These orders are

                        particular problem for the Department of State, which remained responsible
                        in the early 20th century for certain domestic duties, including publishing
                        laws, joint resolutions, treaties, and certain other congressional
                        documents. Printing obligations for Congress, not paid for by the
                        legislative branch, cut deeply into the Departmental allotment. Moreover,
                        the Department had often used contingency funds designated for the
                        Diplomatic and Consular Services to defray the printing expenses of those
                        bureaus, thereby augmenting the total printing budget. The 1906 law
                        specifically disallowed that practice. Absent additional appropriations from
                        Congress, the Department did not control enough money to meet all its
                        publishing requirements. The relatively expensive <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> took a back seat to mundane but immediate (and less costly)
                        printing needs such as passport books, customs forms, and Departmental

                            for publishing that could be neither exceeded nor augmented. Moreover,
                            any unexpended credits remaining at the end of the fiscal year did not

                        documents so soon after events. Wilson did not oppose transparency in
                        principle, but he wished to reduce significantly its scope and substantially

                        curtail dramatically the timely release of diplomatic correspondence. To
                        meet his immediate objections, they compromised to the extent of proposing a

                        insights. As might be expected in an intra-bureaucratic quarrel, the
                        disputants concentrated on how <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> either
                        facilitated or degraded the conduct of Departmental business. They referred
                        only tangentially to the value of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to Congress,
                        the public, and posterity. Root’s reaction, however, indicates his awareness
                        of those larger constituencies’ interest in transparency.<note place="foot"

                            legislators; he received a request for the 1906 volume from Congressman

                        printing appropriations remained a key factor retarding the series’s
                        progress. Department officials repeatedly appealed for more funding,
                        specifically requesting money to publish <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, but
                        they met with no success. Compilation continued amid all the war work, but
                        when completed, manuscripts gathered dust at the press for want of
                        allocations to print. In December 1916, the Senate Committee on Printing
                        informed federal agencies that because the cost of paper had “enormously
                        increased,” it had become necessary to conserve remaining printing stock by
                        temporarily suspending or permanently abolishing any nonessential
                        publications. Secretary of State Robert Lansing replied that <hi

                        The very gradual increase in compilation time and even publication dates

                        in a discourse that subtly surrendered to deadline extensions. In May 1914,
                        Rolls and Library Division Chief John Tonner characterized the series as
                        “usually about two years behind.” In arguing for more printing money he
                        stated, “at times it gets several years behind.” With proper funding the
                        Department “can get it up nearer than two years usually.” House
                        Appropriations Subcommittee Chair John Fitzgerald (D–NY) asked, “is it not
                        the policy to have it a little behind?” to which Tonner replied, “yes, in

                        place: <quote rend="blockquote-transcript">
                            <p>The CHAIRMAN. How soon is the publication supposed to be out?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. They are always a couple of years behind. We can not very
                                well bring them up to date on account of collating the material. A
                                lot of the material could be printed in two years, but probably they
                                would not want to print it just at the present time, and therefore
                                we are always about two years behind. We aim to catch up next
                                year.</p>
                            <p><anchor xml:id="b_815"/>Mr. MONDELL. Is their value not largely
                                decreased by the fact that they are not printed until so long after
                                the events occur?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. No; I think not. They are a matter of permanent record.
                                They date back from the very beginning of the government.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MONDELL. Is there some policy in the matter of delay?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. It is the difficulty of collating the material, of course
                                and there is some material that could go in 18 months after
                                something transpired that they possibly would not want to put in
                                just at the time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MONDELL. That is what I had in mind. It is a matter of policy not
                                to publish the book too soon?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. Yes; and we have never been what you might call up to

                            <p>Mr. MONDEL. Is it necessary to be that far behind in printing a

                            <p>Mr. TONNER. I do not know that it is necessary; but you see there are
                                many papers that can not be published until after a certain
                                time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MONDELL. It gets to be ancient history before it is printed?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. The trouble is there is some material that we do not want
                                printed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MONDELL. You want it to be ancient history before it is

                            <p>Mr. TONNER. Yes; in some respects, I suppose. Some of it for the time
                                being is confidential, but does not remain confidential after a
                                period of a few years.</p>
                            <p>The CHAIRMAN. And you do not publish these volumes until sufficient
                                time has elapsed so that the information can be published?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. Yes. Of course, everything for that year is not
                                published, and it only includes such material as can be published.
                                You can not always determine within the year what is to be
                                published.</p>

                            <p>Mr. TONNER. No; it will not make much difference except to the people
                                interested in the publication. The department tries to keep it up
                                and we would have printed the 1911 volume if it had not been for the
                                war. Some years ago we were up to within two years of the time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. BORLAND. There was nothing very critical in 1911 that you could
                                not publish now?</p>
                            <p>Mr. TONNER. No; but the war has prevented the people who are engaged

                        remained universally accepted; however difficult to achieve and tardy in

                        remained valuable for Departmental operations, and that informed public
                        debate about world affairs required rapid dissemination of as much
                        information as possible. Academic organizations began to lobby for faster
                        release to facilitate teaching about important international issues.
                        Continued delays risked the impression that the government was suppressing
                        information, a clear threat to the credibility that underlay support for
                        democratic institutions. Both executive branch officials and elected
                        representatives noted that Congress would benefit from more timely volumes.

                        that “it would be a mistake not to provide funds to correct the mistakes of
                        the past.” He advocated allocating sufficient appropriations “to see that we

                        information should be kept current.<note place="foot" n="45"

                        funding, the Department had to moderate claims that the volumes <hi
                            rend="italic">must</hi> be published within a fixed time frame. If the
                        principal value of the series depended on timely transmittal of information
                        to Congress, a five- or ten-year lag called into question whether the
                        volumes merited publication at all. As a practical matter, little
                        documentation concerning U.S. diplomatic activity about the war could be
                        published during the hostilities in any case. A minority of the diplomatic
                        corps had never much liked the series anyway, and would have been glad to
                        see the volumes deferred or eliminated altogether. As a justification for
                        delayed release, both security guardians and transparency advocates
                        emphasized the value of comprehensive coverage. The advantage to less timely
                        publication, at least in theory, resided in the inclusion of material deemed
                        too sensitive to reveal at a remove of only six months or one year. The 19th
                        century executive-legislative bargain that privileged near-contemporaneous
                        release in order to facilitate accountability shifted by the 1920s in favor
                        of more comprehensive coverage at the expense of timeliness. To some extent,
                        this constituted an expedient maneuver; it appeared that, at least in the
                        immediate postwar period, the volumes would continue to fall short of the
                        traditional next-year schedule in any case. Yet accepting not only the fact
                        of, but the <hi rend="italic">value of</hi>, delayed publication presented a
                        host of new issues.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1382"/>However appealing the prospect of trading
                        timeliness for comprehensive coverage might appear in the abstract,
                        attempting to realize either objective presented wholly unprecedented
                        challenges in the postwar era. First, by 1920, the series was already seven
                        or eight years behind in production of the “regular” annual volumes. To
                        close the gap would require a considerable infusion of human and capital
                        resources. Moreover, the “regular” 1914–1918 volumes included little
                        documentation about U.S. actions with regard to the war. Certain types of
                        sensitive material had traditionally been excised from <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi>, but since the inception of the series, the only formal
                        hostilities involving the United States had been the “splendid little war”
                        of 1898. That contest spanned less than eight months from first shot to
                        peace accord, but it nevertheless took the Department two extra years to
                        digest that material and get the series back on schedule. The documentation
                        detailing U.S. involvement in the war of 1914–1918, which had been withheld
                        from immediate publication with no appreciable complaint from Congress or
                        public, dwarfed by several orders of magnitude anything in the series’s
                        previous history. Many supplemental volumes would be required to chronicle
                        that story, as well as the sprawling and controversial postwar negotiations
                        of 1919. Even if the government committed very significant personnel assets
                        and printing funds to such a project, the compiling and editing alone would
                        require many years to complete. And finally, that multitude of war-era
                        American documents necessarily included significant exchanges with foreign
                        governments, often about highly-sensitive topics. Desirous of international
                        and bilateral cooperation on multiple fronts in the postwar period, U.S.
                        officials ascribed greater importance to other nations’ reservations about
                        what the Department of State published. The postwar production process for
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes took account of foreign equities in
                        unprecedented measure, which both slowed the clearance process and limited
                        the series’s capacity to offer truly comprehensive coverage.<anchor

                    <p>In the post-World War I era, the key dilemma facing both producers and
                        consumers of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> involved the very

                        reveal? That question highlighted several crucial definitional and
                        decisional dilemmas. What criteria should be used to make release decisions?
                        What is the appropriate amount of time that should elapse between events and
                        the publication of documents? When can a particular issue be considered
                        closed, and therefore suitable to divulge? Should some information <hi
                            rend="italic">never</hi> be revealed? Most importantly, who should
                        decide these questions, and should there be any mechanism for appeal?
                            <anchor xml:id="b_1377-end" corresp="#b_1377-start"/></p>
                    <p>Ultimately, all those questions boiled down to the issue of deadlines.
                        Although postwar complaints from many quarters decried the lateness of the
                        series with rhetoric expressing the desire to “catch up,” or the need to
                        “get closer to the present,” no consensus emerged about whether the
                        appropriate time of release should be three years, or five, or ten. Soon the
                        discussion extended normative expectations to twelve or fifteen years.
                        Moore’s remonstrations notwithstanding, over time fewer and fewer talked
                        about the possibility or—importantly—the <hi rend="italic">desirability</hi>
                        of returning to a six month norm, which had remained the mainstream
                        expectation (in principle if not in recent practice) until at least

                        never again served as a contemporaneous aid to congressional decision making

                        fifteen years behind currency. The press often paid less attention to the
                        appearance of new volumes since they no longer produced timely revelations
                        about foreign policy. Over time, historians, teachers of international law,
                        political scientists, and a variety of other academic constituencies
                        expressed increasing interest in the continued publication of <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, and they also lobbied for as
                        timely production as feasible. Nevertheless, the rationale for the series’s
                        existence shifted from an immediate public accountability tool to a
                        longer-term investment in presenting a comprehensive account of past
                        actions.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_561"/>Although a certain amount of counterfactual
                        extrapolation is required, it is possible to envisage alternative paths that
                        illustrate the profound repercussions of this retreat from currency. Had the
                        series been up to date, the 1913 volume would have been released before the
                        war started in August 1914. Owing to wartime exigencies and postwar
                        complications, the series would likely still have retreated from the
                        next-year standard, probably permanently. Postwar discussions about
                        appropriate timeliness, however, might have focused on getting the series
                        back to a reasonably contemporaneous three- or five-year line rather than
                        the fifteen years that quickly became the norm. In succeeding decades it is
                        likely that the series would have lagged more, but if the “baseline” for
                        further recession had started at 5 or 10 rather than 15 years, transparency
                        expectations today might dictate publication at a 20- or 25-year line rather
                        than the current 30 years. Although one might assume that, regardless of
                        other considerations, the security concerns of the Cold War era would have
                        necessitated extension to a 30-year line, Presidents John F. Kennedy and
                        Richard Nixon did not think so. Kennedy directed the series to be published
                        at a 15-year line, and Nixon ordered a 20-year production schedule. Only in
                        1985, near the end of the Cold War (as it turned out) did President Reagan
                        accede to a 30-year timetable. Moreover, the production of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes directly affected Department policy
                        about when archival material would be made available to the public. The
                        Department of State example affected overall expectations about when the
                        U.S. government should open archival records. At an international level, the
                        publication of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> and American archival openness
                        practices had a significant impact on transparency norms. The U.S. retreat
                        from near-currency enabled some governments to impose longer intervals
                        before documents including non-U.S. equities could be printed in <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, which, in turn, affected policies governing
                        when those nations should release their own foreign policy documentation.
                        Some other democratic governments concluded, over time, that they must make
                        their own records more available. Had <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> been
                        publishing on a schedule five or ten years closer to the present than was
                        actually the case, those governments might have been inclined to implement
                        more liberal policies as well. It is conceivable to posit that a more timely
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series could have produced
                        greater transparency expectations for governments and peoples outside the

                        <anchor xml:id="b_620"/>Since its inception in 1861, there had never been
                        any hard-and-fast rules about <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>.
                        Congress did not impose a deadline for the appearance of volumes, nor did
                        the President ever promise to deliver by a date certain. A powerful
                        expectation arose that (absent extraordinary circumstances) the volumes
                        should be published within six months after the year chronicled, and both
                        branches of government adhered to that norm without recourse to law,
                        executive order, or Departmental edict. Nor were any explicit criteria for
                        withholding promulgated, though a general consensus maintained about what
                        material should not be released. William Hunter and Alvey Adee provided the
                        Department’s institutional knowledge for these norms and practices, spanning
                        the entire era from William Seward to Calvin Coolidge. The Contemporaneous
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> of 1861–1905 took little account of whether
                        the volumes inconvenienced foreign governments, American diplomats, or U.S.
                        Presidents. That original concept died at almost the same moment Alvey Adee
                        collapsed in 1924, still on the active roster of Departmental officers. As
                        if to symbolize the change, the position of Second Assistant Secretary of
                        State expired with him. Within a year, Secretary of State Frank Kellogg
                        promulgated formal principles devised by a professional historian for the
                        editing of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. His 1925
                        charter for the 20th century <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series drew upon
                        his forebears’ tradition to steer a new course in a much-altered

                            Relations</hi> series left its 19th century roots behind as it
                        experienced profound transformations in purpose, production, clearance
                        procedures, and audiences. In 1925, within months of the Department of
                        State’s recruitment of a professionally trained historian to take charge of
                        its publications program, Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg approved the
                        first formal editorial guidelines for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. Kellogg’s
                        order mandated historical “objectivity,” as derived from emerging scholarly
                        best practices, and served as the charter for the series (with minor
                        revisions) until 1991. Despite this high-level endorsement for <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, unprecedented clearance problems,
                        both within the U.S. Government and with other countries, resulted in
                        steadily mounting delays and, occasionally, significant excisions in
                        published volumes. During the 1930s, political controversies over the
                        outbreak and legacies of World War I heightened foreign government anxieties
                        about releasing potentially sensitive historical information. World War II
                        exacerbated those difficulties. Counterpoised against this impulse for
                        secrecy, professional academic organizations lobbied for timelier
                        publication and more comprehensive documentation. Although <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> continued to garner occasional congressional and media
                        attention, during the 1930s and 1940s, scholars established themselves as
                        the primary direct consumers of the series. By the end of World War II, the
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series had evolved to become an
                        instrument of responsible historical transparency.</p>

                        the series left new constituencies, primarily the academic community,
                        unsatisfied with meager coverage of the decisionmaking process in

                            our own assessment as described in previous chapters. No other account
                            of the series has utilized the wide variety of sources consulted for
                            this study. Detractors in the 1920s and 1930s applied their contemporary
                            expectations for historical coverage to past volumes without
                            appreciating that the series served a different function between 1861
                            and 1906. They also did not account for documentation included in
                            Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions. They denigrated
                            the proto-professional documentary editing capacities of compilers and
                            reviewers rather than acknowledging that these capacities were
                            state-of-the-art for the time period. After Adee’s death in 1924, no
                            direct institutional memory of 19th century practice remained in the
                            Department. Disparagement of the “old” <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> may
                            have also proved advantageous in attempts to secure additional funding
                            and more highly-qualified personnel to produce the series.</note> In
                        1930, Dr. Joseph Fuller, who headed the Research Section of the Division of
                        Publications, derided the “perfunctory character” of the 19th century <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. He caricatured the contents of volumes
                        published before 1924 as “innocuous material—exchanges of birthday
                        greetings, records of ceremonial visits, formal documents, and emasculated
                        correspondence on more serious topics.” Returning to this approach in
                        response to clearance difficulties (described below) would, Fuller
                        predicted, lead the series to “lose all credit in the eyes of scholars who
                        would naturally depend on it for the material of their studies.”<note

                            Giffen (Ph.D., University of Chicago) recommended against making
                            austerity cuts to the Research Section of the Office of the Historical
                            Adviser: “Although it might be possible to continue <hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi> with “men of lower grade and lower pay,” Giffen argued
                            that the “increasingly exacting” task of selecting documents from the
                            “growing volume” of Department records required “qualities of skill,
                            experience, knowledge, and judgment which, while not precisely rare, are
                            certainly not universal among even educated men.” Maintaining the new
                            professional standards introduced in the mid-1920s required greater
                            expenditures than giving the work to “raw boys just out of college.”
                            Giffen warned “their product would have to be thoroughly overhauled to
                            guard against omissions, errors, and faults of judgment” before it could
                            be used by the Department—or released to the public. In 1933, the
                            Department created a new Division of Research and Publications (which
                            was responsible for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) alongside the Office of
                            the Historical Adviser (which retained responsibility for compiling the
                                <hi rend="italic">Treaties and Other International Acts of the
                                United States of America</hi> volumes). As the first head of
                            Research and Publications, Wynne took formal charge of <hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi> production at that time. The Office of the Historical
                            Adviser was renamed the Office of the Editor of the Treaties in 1938.

                        new <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> by proposing formal editorial guidelines to
                        define the purpose of the series and establish clear standards for omissions
                        in published documents. Less than three months after taking office, Dennett
                        submitted draft principles to Assistant Secretary MacMurray. In framing the
                        new <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> charter, Dennett echoed familiar statements
                        of purpose for the series: “A well informed intelligent public opinion is of
                        the utmost importance to the conduct of foreign relations” and therefore “as
                        much of the [diplomatic] correspondence as is practicable ought to be made
                        public.” <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> provided “in a form economical,
                        compact, and easily accessible, the documentary history of the foreign
                        relations of the United States” and, as such, “must therefore be recognized
                        as an important part of the duties of the Department of State.” Dennett
                        proffered four admissible justifications for exclusions: <list

                        precedents established during the 18th and 19th centuries shaped the first
                        formal guidelines for deciding what kinds of information the Department
                        could release to the public responsibly and what kinds of information it had
                        to keep secret to safeguard the public interest.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1294"/>Later in March, MacMurray hosted a meeting where
                        Dennett and other high-ranking Department officials held a “thorough
                        discussion of the principles which ought to guide the editing of <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>.” Their conversation yielded a
                        consensus that added two “innovations” to existing <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> traditions. The first concerned including in <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> “decisions of the Department on subjects of
                        international law which are of peculiar interest to students.” The second
                        entailed “publication of important documents concerning treaty negotiations”
                        (which had typically been covered by Supplemental <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> Submissions in the 19th century) that would “increase the
                        value of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> as a source-book of
                        American history.” Dennett informed Secretary of State Kellogg that “this
                        proposed new material ought to contribute to the promotion of interest in
                        questions of foreign policy and in turn assist in the maintenance of an
                        intelligent public opinion.” The consensus was also important because it
                        established “a uniform standard for . . . the editing of diplomatic
                        correspondence” for the entire Department. Moreover, Dennett believed that
                        publicizing the new <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> guidelines would help the
                        Department “define some of the aspects of the necessary limitations upon
                        ‘open diplomacy.’”<note place="foot" n="19" xml:id="chapter-6fn19"><anchor

                            later account of the background for this order explained that one of the

                            supporters included Undersecretary Joseph Grew, Assistant Secretary John
                            V.A. MacMurray, Assistant Secretary Wilbur Carr, and Western European
                            Affairs Division Chief William Castle. Grew’s support for releasing
                            historical documents was not universal. In 1926, he overruled
                            subordinates in the Department to block release of an 1865 instruction
                            from Secretary of State William Seward to the U.S. Minister in France,
                            John Bigelow, in response to a congressional request on behalf of a
                            constituent researcher. The instruction included the statement that “the
                            United States has at various times since its organization found
                            necessity for expansion and that the like necessity may reasonably be
                            expected to occur hereafter.” Grew objected to releasing this statement
                            because “if published, even though sixty years old, [it] would
                            inevitably cause undesirable discussion in Mexico and the other
                            countries of Latin America as tending to substantiate their traditional
                            charge that the United States is endeavoring and intends eventually to
                            obtain political hegemony throughout the two continents.” See Grew to

                        to document “all major policies and decisions of the Department in the
                        matter of foreign relations.” It mandated that, aside from “trivial and
                        inconsequential details,” the volumes “be substantially complete as regards
                        the files of the Department.” “Nothing,” the order specified, “should be
                        omitted with a view to concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by
                        some as a defect of policy.” This required a caveat to Dennett’s initial
                        proposal to exclude “personal opinions” from published <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes: “in major decisions it is desirable, where possible,
                        to show the choices presented to the Department when the decision was made.”
                        Finally, the order instituted an important change from 19th century practice
                        that conceded the altered circumstances of post-World War American
                        diplomacy: a prohibition on publishing foreign government documents without
                        first securing that government’s permission. This mandate was originally
                        interpreted narrowly: only documents originating from a foreign government
                        required such clearance. The Department retained the authority to decide
                        whether to publish U.S. documents (i.e., authored by American diplomats)
                        that contained foreign government information (FGI), such as memoranda of
                        conversation with foreign officials.<note place="foot" n="22"

                        Dennett began evaluating Department records in preparation for reviving <hi

                        In a letter to outgoing Secretary Charles Evans Hughes, Dennett described
                        how “the distinction which has been made between public and private papers”
                        had left the U.S. Government with “extremely defective” records of recent
                        diplomacy. He cited his own research in Theodore Roosevelt’s papers for his
                        work on U.S.-East Asian relations to explain “how much important diplomatic
                        correspondence was not a matter of record in the Department of State”: “the
                        Department records” by themselves were “so defective that the narrative of .
                        . . important events cannot be given from the official correspondence.”
                        Dennett’s “casual . . . survey” of Department records for the “war years”
                        revealed them to be “extremely deficient,” and, when such “deficiencies are
                        eventually revealed by the publication of the Department diplomatic
                        correspondence,” he warned Hughes, “the Government is then placed in an
                        awkward and embarrassing position.”<note place="foot" n="23"

                        This effort was necessary because the Department excluded war-related
                        documentation from the regular annual volumes that it had already published
                        for the years 1914 and 1915. In his testimony for the 1928 appropriations

                        Government which has not given to the public its diplomatic correspondence
                        of the war period. . . . It seems to me that that correspondence, following

                        their colleagues in the Department as discussion shifted from general
                        principles to publishing specific documents. In 1929 and 1930, concerns
                        about the risks of releasing sensitive information jeopardized Dennett’s
                        efforts to revive the series and close the widening publication gap. The
                        1916 supplement for the war was “held up” in 1929 by Secretary of State
                        Henry Stimson and President Herbert Hoover pending the conclusion of naval

                        supplementary volumes on the Russian Revolution. On April 25, 1930, Dennett
                        met with officials in the Division of Far Eastern Affairs (FE) to discuss
                        their opposition to publishing U.S. reporting on conditions in Eastern
                        Siberia and Manchuria in 1918. FE officials feared release of those
                        documents would “constitute an indictment of Japanese activities, the
                        appearance of which in an official series might give such an offense as to
                        embarrass the present conduct of relations with Japan.” Roland Morris, the
                        former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, supported Dennett’s arguments that his
                        telegrams “formed an essential part of the record and should be included” if
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> were to document the story of Japanese
                        “military authorities’ breach of faith” and the “American Government’s moves
                        to check” their expansionism. Nevertheless, he agreed with FE Chief Stanley
                        Hornbeck that “this story had better be left untold in our
                            publication.”<note place="foot" n="30" xml:id="chapter-6fn30">Fuller,

                    <p>Dennett resisted FE’s restrictive impulse. He complained that excising the
                        documents dealing with Japan’s role in Russia would “ruin three volumes”
                        representing “a year’s work apiece by three members of our staff and the
                        expenditure of over $5,000 for printing.” To excise “the record of Japanese
                        action and American reaction is to leave out an essential part” of the story
                        “and to present a mangled and transparent farce which would be worse than
                        the total omission.” Dennett also recruited support from the Division of
                        Eastern European Affairs, which judged “the story of America’s relationship
                        to the interventions in Russia . . . one of the most creditable aspects of
                        our Russian policy. Its omission . . . would seem to result in a disturbance
                        of the balance unfavorable to the credit of our Government.” By enlisting
                        support from other Department officials, Dennett forced his colleagues to
                        take a wider view of the choice confronting them. Whatever risks the 1918
                        Russia supplement posed to U.S.–Japanese relations, the Department had to
                        balance them against the possible benefits of clarifying the limits of
                        American intervention in the Russian Revolution and meeting the Department’s
                        publicly announced commitment to responsible transparency.<note place="foot"

                        Japan material intact in 1932. Just as FE warned, the volume elicited “a
                        good deal of comment and discussion in Tokyo.” Although the Japanese
                        Government did not lodge a formal protest, Ambassador Katsuji Debuchi
                        registered concern about the publication with Secretary of State

                        Dennett “resigned from the Department . . . [to] wide publicity [that]
                        resulted in much unfavorable criticism . . . partly because he believed the

                        publication lag, early 20th century <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilers
                        had to make tough decisions when the Department’s or another government’s
                        reluctance to release significant documents stalled the publication of other
                        important material. Amidst the debate over the 1918 Russia supplement
                        volumes, Fuller suggested jettisoning the “annual volume” model in favor of
                        more topical volumes “relating to single or small groups of countries or
                        subjects over convenient periods of years.” Not only would such compilations
                        allow for streamlined clearances within the Department, but “volumes on
                        certain subjects could be held back without delaying others and without
                        impairing the integrity of the publications issued.” Fuller anticipated that
                        delayed publication of volumes covering especially sensitive regions or
                        topics would “be less obvious than when brought repeatedly to public notice
                        by glaring omissions in one annual volume after another.” Fuller’s scheme
                        would “break up <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> into handier, more
                        logical units” that could be produced, cleared, and published more rapidly
                        than the existing annual volumes. It also offered a more finely-textured way
                        to reconcile the Department’s general commitment to transparency with
                        specific diplomatic and security sensitivities.<note place="foot" n="34"

                        disclosing confidential communications with British intelligence officers in
                        revolutionary Russia. Although Poole’s concern about disclosing intelligence
                        sources and methods anticipated later efforts to accord intelligence
                        information special protections against disclosure, his complaint employed
                        the same “old diplomacy” discourse as Engert’s telegram. In 1919 Poole had
                        served as U.S. liaison with anti-Bolshevik Russian groups and as the <hi

                        in European Russia. Nearly two decades later, he wrote Secretary Cordell
                        Hull to protest the inclusion of one of his confidential despatches in the
                        1919 Russia volume. Poole saw no reason why “a little considerate effort”
                        was not made to “conserve a suitable regard for the conventions of
                        gentlemanly intercourse” and edit the cable in question to obscure the
                        source of his reporting, a British army officer. He predicted that the
                        disclosure would injure relations between U.S. diplomats and the British and
                        “tend to destroy that complete confidence which the public interest requires
                        to exist between American Foreign Service Officers and the Department of

                        the 1925 order. He warned that retreating from a 15-year line would result
                        in thunderous criticism from the academic community. The Department
                        historian also belittled both Engert and Poole, suggesting that they “take
                        [themselves] perhaps a little too seriously.” Although he acknowledged the
                        “special authority” of “career diplomats,” Wynne preferred the friendly
                        attitudes of “such men as Mr. Joseph Grew and Mr. Howland Shaw, both of
                        whom,” he claimed, “have forgotten more about the Near East than Mr. Engert
                        will ever know in his life.” Wynne placed special emphasis on Grew’s support
                        for a 15-year line, since he served in Japan, “the most difficult post in
                        our entire Foreign Service.”<note place="foot" n="40" xml:id="chapter-6fn40"

                        producing the 1924 and 1925 annual volumes in the late 1930s, the Division
                        of Research and Publication (RP) submitted “a large number” of American
                        memoranda of conversation to foreign governments for clearance. Although

                        the most significant foreign clearance problems for the series. In the
                        mid-1930s, Japan objected to <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s <hi rend="italic"

                        By the end of 1935, RP identified Tokyo as the “usual” source of delays in
                        foreign government clearances. When the documents compiled for the 1922 <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes included information about the 1917
                        Lansing-Ishii Agreement’s secret protocol (pledging restraint in China
                        during World War I) that had already entered the public domain via the
                        former Secretary of State’s memoirs and a widely-read work of diplomatic
                        history, Wynne anticipated that Tokyo would object to their publication.
                        Through Ambassador Grew, he warned that the Japanese Government would be
                        blamed for any omissions of this material to “prevent the Department from
                        being criticized” by “those who are a bit critical of what is described as
                        the ‘Hush! Hush!’ policy in publishing <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi>.” The Japanese Foreign Ministry granted permission to
                        print the documents in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> but requested that, in
                        the future, even retired American officials should secure Tokyo’s permission

                        dissemination of critical American periodicals in Iran. As a result, the
                        1922 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume lacked any

                        officials that “their present position with regard to publication of

                        publish documents from the 1919 Peace Conference. As the Department noted in

                        clearance issues. The volumes also required systematic research in private

                        French Foreign Ministry recoiled at the proposal to publish such politically
                        sensitive records in the midst of international tensions directly related to
                        the postwar settlement. When Director of Political Affairs at the French
                        Foreign Ministry René Massigli met with Edwin Wilson, Counselor of the U.S.
                        Embassy in Paris, he argued that “Europe was today in a highly dangerous
                        situation, perilously near war, and every effort was being made by those in
                        responsible positions to prevent war, to save civilization, and with that
                        end in view to appease conflicts and remove so far as possible every pretext
                        for misunderstanding.” Wilson reported that Massigli “was frankly terrified
                        at the thought of how publication of the secret documents of the Peace
                        Conference could be seized upon by people who want to promote trouble and
                        misunderstanding. As between the embarrassment . . . by being put in the
                        position of objecting to the publication of these documents, and the danger
                        of adding fuel to the flames of international controversies, he much
                        preferred the former.” Even delayed publication, Massigli worried, “might
                        merely prejudice the work of appeasement which might have been done in the
                        meanwhile.” Massigli concluded the conversation by pointing out that, “if
                        during the next month things take a turn for the worse, our thoughts may
                        look forward to the next peace conference rather than to the question of
                        publishing the documents of the last one.”<note place="foot" n="60"

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_347"/>The outbreak of the war created new difficulties for
                        the Paris Peace Conference volumes and, after the United States entered the
                        war, British and American leaders vetoed releasing especially sensitive
                        records out of fear that doing so could undermine their own summit
                        diplomacy. Even after the Department secured agreement in principle to the
                        project, it still had to obtain clearances for specific documents proposed
                        for publication. The first Peace Conference volumes appeared in 1942, in
                        part because the fall of France and hostilities with Italy nullified two
                        foreign equities that might otherwise impede publication. Great Britain, the
                        lone remaining foreign equity-holder, reluctantly agreed to release the
                        majority of Peace Conference records in 1942.<note place="foot" n="63"

                        records. Eden explained that “the publication in particular of the minutes
                        of the Council of Four would have a cramping effect upon any similar
                        confidential discussions which it may be necessary to hold after the present

                        propagandists with welcome material.” Finally, Eden objected to the
                        publication of “rough workings kept for the convenience of the statesmen
                        concerned” while one of those statesmen—David Lloyd George—was still

                        President Franklin Roosevelt intervened to quash the Council of Four
                        volumes. In preparation for a September 1943 Hyde Park summit meeting with
                        Churchill, Roosevelt asked Secretary Hull why the U.S. Government intended
                        to publish the Council minutes. The President expressed “distinct
                        hesitation,” believing that “notes of these conversations ought not to have
                        been taken down anyway.”<note place="foot" n="67" xml:id="chapter-6fn67"

                        avoid releasing any information that could potentially be used to criticize

                        publishing the full record of the Paris Peace Conference, as well as the

                    <p>Roosevelt remained unconvinced. He told Hull that publication “would probably
                        result in wholly unwarranted sensational articles” from “hostile sources.”
                        He also explained that “no notes should have been kept. Four people cannot
                        be conversationally frank with each other if someone is taking down notes
                        for future publication.” Roosevelt “felt very strongly about this” and,

                        documents during World War II did not apply to material intended to mobilize
                        public support for the war effort. On June 17, 1942, Hull proposed to
                        Roosevelt publication of “papers pertaining to relations between Japan and
                        the United States dating from the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931
                        to the outbreak of war.” The compilation, which “would be of a character
                        similar to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</hi>,” “would cover American-Japanese relations in general and also
                        deal with the conversations of 1941 in regard to means of solving problems
                        underlying relations between the two countries.” While Hull “realized that
                        there are possible disadvantages to publication at this time,” he believed
                        that “on balance it would be desirable to publish these papers” since they
                        demonstrated “that this Government could not sit still and watch Japan carry
                        out a program of unlimited aggression to the menace of our national
                        security.” Since the envisioned compilation included many records of
                        Roosevelt’s personal involvement in prewar diplomacy with Japan, Hull wanted
                        explicit permission from the President to proceed with the project. On June
                        20, Roosevelt responded: “OK. Cover it all.”<note place="foot" n="73"

                        Harvard law professor Manley O. Hudson, suggested that—for some academic
                        purposes—the “series ‘presents too little too late.’” Hudson evaluated the

                        To improve <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> for historians, he urged the

                        released 56 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes covering the years between
                        1913 and 1930. The average lag in publication doubled during the period. In
                        the tense international atmosphere of the late 1930s and the war years,
                        releasing sensitive documents that drew attention to the post-World War I
                        settlement seemed unnecessarily risky to many in Europe and East Asia, but
                        essential to democratic accountability in the United States. Balancing
                        transparency and national security grew increasingly difficult during the
                        1930s and produced additional kinds of tension during the Second World War.
                        In February 1945, as the prospect of victory over Germany came into view,
                        Wilder Spaulding reported to Assistant Secretary of State Archibald MacLeish
                        that “our first objective in publishing [<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>]
                        volumes is to produce a ‘substantially’ complete and honest definitive
                        record which should, so far as possible, be above criticism by experts who
                        are inevitably suspecting the Department of suppression of the record.” In
                        balancing demands for timeliness and concerns for security, Spaulding
                        predicted that “the nearest approach we can make to the ideal time lag would
                        be ten years.”<note place="foot" n="88" xml:id="chapter-6fn88">Spaulding to

                        Department of State published 56 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes, nearly
                        doubling the pace established during the previous quarter century. The
                        average publication lag crept upward from 16 years to 18 years. That
                        relatively minor increase in the publication lag masked significant
                        challenges to producing the series after World War II. The Cold War added
                        another dimension to <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> clearance difficulties
                        because new entities such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department
                        of Defense, and the National Security Council played substantial roles in
                        foreign affairs. During the interwar period, interagency coordination for
                        research and declassification of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        compilations had been largely unnecessary. Since practically all of the
                        documentation for most volumes came from Department of State files, little
                        reason existed to consult other agencies for clearance. Although the Paris
                        Peace Conference volumes required an unprecedented amount of research beyond
                        Department files, most of that work involved private papers at the Library

                        scholarly standards. Instead, the program operated as an instrument of
                        public diplomacy and psychological warfare directed toward foreign audiences

                        MacLeish to approve a publication program designed to pre-empt historical
                        revisionism concerning the origins of World War II. This project would
                        release “full, frank, and convincing” documentation that was “much more
                        complete than what was printed in [the 1943 volumes on prewar Pacific

                        directly to the war.” If the Department had difficulty gaining access to
                        essential documents in Roosevelt’s papers that made it impossible to compile
                        a coherent narrowly-focused collection of documents, it should “at least”

                        President Samuel Eliot Morison, Truman declared that “Communist imperialism
                        has made falsehood a dangerous weapon; but truth can be a far more potent
                        weapon. American historians can contribute to the cause of the free nations

                        Cold War imperatives affected the timeliness of the series as well as
                        decisionmaking about the declassification of U.S. Government records. When
                        the Cold War began, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> averaged a 15-year
                        publication line; by the 1980s, that lag had doubled to around 30 years.
                        Volumes also received greater scrutiny within the U.S. Government before
                        they were released. In part, this was a consequence of the widened
                        bureaucratic scope of the compilations. As <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        included more documents from government agencies beyond the Department of
                        State, those agencies gained more authority to review the records chosen for
                        publication. With additional veto-points for clearing records, the
                        declassification process grew increasingly contentious and lengthy.</p>

                        risks of releasing historical information. As Mary Dudziak explains, “once

                        belligerents to embrace “extraordinary action” even as they “belie[ve] that
                        [the wartime] moment will end decisively. . . . In wartime thinking, the

                        “modernization” came from an unexpected source: a partisan political
                        maneuver in the early 1950s that resulted in the “Yalta Papers” controversy.
                        The Yalta documentation project began in late 1947 as a classified analysis
                        of wartime conference records requested by Department officials for internal
                        use. The resultant policy study formed the basis of a <hi rend="italic"

                        in 1954 and 1955. Release of the Yalta Papers generated headline news across
                        the United States on March 17 and throughout the rest of the world the next
                        day. Churchill commented on the documents in Parliament on March 17,

                        episode, however, only became apparent over time. Creating the volume forced
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians to adopt key methodological
                        changes. Expanded research and compilation expectations required Department
                        historians, led by Bernard Noble, to mine an unprecedented array of
                        governmental and non-governmental archives. To declassify and release these
                        records only 10 years after the Yalta summit, even under insistent
                        congressional pressure, Noble confronted intense opposition from officials
                        in the Department of State and the Pentagon. The production of the Yalta
                        volume established interagency precedents that shaped all subsequent <hi

                        creation of the volume spurred the Department to institutionalize academic
                        community oversight for the series by creating the Historical Advisory

                        Cold War tensions, policymakers needed a clear understanding of wartime
                        diplomacy to build a stable postwar order. In November 1947, the Bureau of
                        Far Eastern Affairs (FE) requested that RE compile information about
                        international conference discussions and decisions relating to East Asia
                        dating back to 1943. Franklin Roosevelt had marginalized the Department of
                        State as he conducted high-level diplomacy from the White House. Department
                        officials, therefore, lacked important information about critical
                        negotiations and agreements. With records of the major summit meetings
                        scattered in various office and personal file collections across the
                        Department—as well as throughout the rest of the government—seemingly
                        straightforward questions like “What did Roosevelt discuss with Chiang at
                        the First Cairo Conference?” proved nearly impossible to answer.<note

                        task of producing a comprehensible account of the Yalta Conference. To the
                        extent that the Department had an institutional memory of the wartime
                        conferences, it was maintained by Charles Bohlen, Counselor of the
                        Department. His office files included the informal minutes he kept as
                        Franklin Roosevelt’s interpreter in meetings with Josef Stalin. In 1948 and
                        1949, RE began collecting additional relevant records in other Department
                        offices and bureaus as well as non-Departmental sources, including the
                        Pentagon, the White House, and the Franklin Roosevelt Presidential Library
                        at Hyde Park, NY. Even for a classified, official policy study, securing

                        the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), proved difficult for RE researchers. After
                        Bohlen transferred certain records to the Department’s recordkeeping system
                        in the summer of 1949, RE took over full responsibility for systematically
                        compiling the records of all the wartime conferences.<note place="foot"

                        to produce comprehensive documentary collections. Roosevelt himself created
                        one daunting obstacle—he disliked keeping detailed records of
                        decisionmaking. As Ralph Perkins, the Chief of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        complete” from the memoir literature and that publishing the Yalta documents
                        posed several risks. Some statements in the minutes of summit meetings, he

                        new Republican congressional majority dictated a different choice. On April
                        22, 1953, Senate Majority Leader William Knowland (R–CA) sent Secretary of
                        State John Foster Dulles a letter that quoted from an unattributed
                        memorandum claiming that RE was sitting on “a rich mine of historical
                        materials of immediate political significance.” Knowland’s source explained
                        that, “before the American people can know in detail the bungling of
                        diplomacy by the Roosevelt-Truman Administrations this material must be
                        published.” Unfortunately, “old-line administrators” and “Roosevelt–Acheson
                        supporters” in the Department of State had “stalled publications of any
                        political importance for the Republicans,” especially <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes for the World War II years. Publishing these records
                        could “give in detail the mishandling of Japanese relations, the failures to
                        estimate the Russian role in the Far East, and the omissions of previous
                        State Department publications on Japanese-American relations” and also
                        “demolish the claims of the <hi rend="italic">China White Paper</hi> and
                        confirm the charges of Democratic misjudgment on the Far East.” Knowland’s
                        correspondent predicted that “if Democratic holdovers in the Division of
                        Historical Policy Research are prevented from excluding key documents these
                        publications would be of tremendous value.” In addition to accelerating
                        production of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes covering U.S. policy
                        toward China in the 1940s, Knowland requested Dulles to publish a special
                        series on the secret wartime conferences held between Allied leaders during
                        World War II.<note place="foot" n="22" xml:id="chapter-7fn22">William

                        Without established procedures for interagency researcher access or
                        declassification review, the Departments of State and Defense had to build a
                        collaborative <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> process from scratch. Facing tight
                        deadlines and congressional scrutiny, both sides pursued their conflicting
                        institutional priorities in a messy process of trial, error, and
                        recrimination. Despite the Secretary of Defense’s pledge of cooperation, his
                        chief historian, Rudolph Winnacker, repeatedly recoiled at Noble’s efforts
                        to examine military records.<note place="foot" n="26" xml:id="chapter-7fn26"

                        bureaucratic friction, but failed to harmonize thinking between State and
                        Defense. Although Winnacker agreed that the wartime conference volumes had

                        crystallized in the executive branch. In an August 1954 review of the first
                        galley proofs of the volume, Winnacker conceded that “the responsibility for
                        decision” to proceed with publishing the Yalta <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> volume “is not mine nor that of the Department of
                        Defense, but that of the Department of State.” He nonetheless tried to
                        convince his counterparts across the Potomac that “this publication at the
                        present time under U.S. Government auspices is not in the national
                        interest.” Despite his familiarity with the wealth of material already a
                        part of the public record, Winnacker reported “a sense of shock when reading
                        in the present EDC [European Defense Community] atmosphere the actual 1945
                        plans for the postwar treatment of Germany, its dismemberment, reparations,
                        and standard of living.” He predicted that “the cavalier disposal of smaller
                        countries or the attitude toward France is also not likely to facilitate our
                        foreign relations.” He also suggested that the compilation would be
                        subjected to withering criticism for the absence of documents from the
                        papers of Secretary of State Edward Stettinius and an “indefensible,”
                        “arbitrary, incomplete, and, at times, silly” selection of pre-conference
                        records. “With such shenanigans,” he predicted, “it is doubtful, to say the
                        least, that this publication will enjoy a reputation for reliability.”
                        Winnacker concluded his review by recommending the project either be
                        forgotten, be published in a revised form (along with “an understanding that
                        mutual assistance funds are to be increased to undo the damage”), or be
                        published in a revised form subject to controls that would “prohibit export
                        or republication in foreign languages.” The one alternative that Winnacker
                        could not accept was to “publish it as a Government publication and ‘In God
                        we Trust.’”<note place="foot" n="31" xml:id="chapter-7fn31">Winnacker

                        European Affairs (EUR) also advised that the Yalta volume was too sensitive
                        to release. Livingston Merchant, the Assistant Secretary of State for
                        European Affairs, argued that “publication at this time would give a great
                        deal of ammunition to the Soviets, as well as to the displaced or subjugated
                        peoples in Central and Eastern Europe, the Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese,
                        which could be used against the U.S. Government on questions which are still
                        controversial and far from settled (e.g. territorial changes).” Merchant
                        urged Dulles to order the deletion of pre-conference background materials
                        that revealed “the permanent workings of the Department, inter-agency
                        conflicts, statements of long-term interests[,] and reports on our allies,”
                        all of which would be of tremendous “intelligence value to other foreign
                        offices.” He feared that “one lesson other foreign offices might draw from
                        such disclosures would be to be more careful about giving us information in
                        the future.” Another danger was that publication would “undermine the
                        relationship of future Secretaries of State and their professional
                        advisors,” which required an “uninhibited willingness . . . to express their
                        views freely . . . on controversial issues.”<note place="foot" n="32"

                        Affairs, went further. He worried that “the cure that is apt to suggest
                        itself to a great many people will be ‘no more secrecy,’ whereas what may be
                        needed is ‘a good deal more diplomacy.’” Although he recognized that the

                        illustrate the shortcomings of the preceding Administration,” Kidd cautioned
                        that “it contains a great deal more which could be used by foreign countries
                        against the U.S. Government and which could be used by the legislative
                        branch against the Executive.” He warned that “if the conclusion were to be
                        drawn from this one conference and agreement that all international
                        conferences and agreements were too full of risk . . . or if the publication

                        obstacle: the British Government had to approve the release of
                        Anglo-American Combined Chiefs of Staff papers that were included in the
                        compilation. As early as November 1953, Richardson Dougall (head of the
                        Policy Studies Branch with responsibility for the wartime conference
                        volumes) had suggested reaching out to Whitehall informally to gauge HMG’s
                        thinking about publishing the records of the wartime summit meetings. In
                        February 1954, Noble heard from James Passant, at the Foreign Office
                        Library, that consultations with the Cabinet Office had begun but that he
                        did “not think it at all likely that permission will be given for the
                        publication in extenso of any of these records which have not yet been
                        published.” Noble replied the following month to suggest that “there is not
                        much secrecy left to the official records of the conference proceedings”
                        after the flood of memoirs during the past nine years. He also assured the
                        British that “none of your documents would be published by us without your
                        consent.” Passant remained skeptical of the project and, in April, urged
                        Noble to lobby the Department to make an official approach to London “on the
                        question of principle involved before any unilateral publication of
                        classified records of conferences” was undertaken.<note place="foot" n="36"

                        was Anglo-American relations, already strained by disputes over China and
                        U.S. skepticism of Churchill’s hopes for Cold War summit diplomacy. Many
                        foreign observers saw the Yalta release as a Department of State gambit to
                        undermine Churchill’s hopes for further “parleys” between world

                        the Yalta Papers could jeopardize NATO’s expansion to include West Germany.
                        The Yalta Papers appeared on the eve of votes in France and Germany to
                        complete ratification of the London and Paris Agreements and to usher a
                        rearmed Federal Republic into the Western alliance. In both countries,
                        however, the Yalta Papers had little effect on policy. Some French
                        politicians used them to illustrate the danger of French isolation and “the
                        empty chair” (the French were not invited to Yalta) while others blamed
                        Anglo-American chauvinism for dividing the continent.<note place="foot"

                        temporary irritant in relations with the United States. The most common
                        reaction in the foreign press was criticism that the release of the Yalta
                        Papers had been driven by partisan politics. For those predisposed to
                        criticize Dulles, the release offered powerful evidence of his “utter
                        incompetence to handle affairs of nations with necessary tact and
                            discretion.”<note place="foot" n="59" xml:id="chapter-7fn59">The quote

                        affirmation of the superpowers’ indifference to their fates. According to an
                        intelligence report prepared in the Department of State, Taiwanese officials
                        privately celebrated to U.S. diplomats that the Yalta Papers helped prove
                        that the U.S. had “lost” China and therefore had a moral obligation to help
                        liberate the mainland. From Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Charles Bohlen reported
                        that Soviet propaganda cited the publication of the “so-called” Yalta Papers
                        as evidence that the United States had abandoned wartime cooperation,
                        undermined the United Nations, and eschewed future summit diplomacy. Later,
                        after the Yalta <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume was printed and published
                        in December, <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> characterized it (along with the
                        March release) as a “falsification of history in service of [the] Cold War.”
                        As irritating as the release of the Yalta documents proved for America’s
                        foreign relations, short-term embarrassment did not fester into lasting
                        damage to U.S. interests abroad.<note place="foot" n="60"

                        consequential within the U.S. Government. Within days of their release on
                        March 16, Winnacker, backed by the JCS, urged the Secretary of Defense to
                        insist on “additional terms of reference . . . to prevent a repetition of
                        the Yalta experience.” He complained that “the entire compilation process
                        during the past months has been accompanied by security violations in the
                        form of leaks of still-classified information to the press, culminating in
                        the clandestine transmittal of a copy of the entire Yalta volume to the New
                        York Times.” He also resented that his advice, which predicted that
                        publishing the Yalta volume would be “prejudicial to the defense interests
                        of the United States,” had been “ignored” despite the “intent of the
                        National Security Act of 1947 . . . to give Defense a voice in decisions on
                        international problems.” Winnacker suggested that “the current State
                        Department concept for its <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,”
                        which “provides for the detailed publication of how policy decisions were
                        reached within this Government, . . . is no longer appropriate for the U.S.
                        now that we are the major world power.” Unless new terms of reference for
                        Defense cooperation could be reached, Winnacker decided, “no more classified
                        military documents will be made available to State for this project.”<note

                        were the scope of the military documentation to be included in future
                        volumes, security handling of records not yet declassified, and
                        administrative procedures for decisionmaking about the declassification and
                        release of specific documents. In the Pentagon, the JCS acted to preserve
                        military institutional prerogatives and force the Department of State to pay
                        greater heed to military advice about declassification issues. Negotiations
                        were fraught with bitterness on both sides. In HD, Assistant Chief for
                        Policy Studies William Franklin fumed that “over-classification, combined
                        with a highly bureaucratic reluctance to declassify documents even ten or
                        more years old, has been a very real part of our basic difficulty with
                        Defense.” In October, State and Defense finally agreed on terms of reference
                        for future World War II-era <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes that
                        affirmed continued inclusion of high-level military documents and preserved
                        State authority over “political” decisions regarding national interests and
                            declassification.<note place="foot" n="63" xml:id="chapter-7fn63">Quote

                        spurred a debate about how (friendly) FGI incorporated into U.S. documents
                        should be cleared for future <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilations. HD
                        argued that only foreign government-originated documents should be submitted
                        for foreign government clearance and that decisions on U.S.
                        documents—regardless of the kind of information that they might
                        contain—should be made exclusively within the U.S. Government. Other
                        Department officials argued that friendly foreign governments should agree
                        before the U.S. Government published documents containing information that
                        they provided. The Department ultimately affirmed the existing distinction
                        between foreign government-originated documents and U.S. documents with FGI,
                        but the Cairo-Tehran and Potsdam compilations—like the Yalta Papers before
                        them—were both sent to London for the British Government’s “information

                        Congress linked continued support for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to
                        partisan demands for the Yalta Papers, the historians, political scientists,
                        and international lawyers who relied on the series worried about its
                        integrity and its survival. They expressed suspicions about the partisan
                        prioritization of the wartime conference and China volumes, which were
                        scheduled for release before regular annual volumes could establish the

                        hoped to prevent further conservative pressure on the series by passing

                        relentlessly criticized management decisions related to the wartime
                        conference volumes. To cultivate congressional pressure on the Department,
                        and especially HD, Barron passed to political allies accusations that Noble,
                        Franklin, and the Roosevelt Presidential Library intentionally suppressed
                        information that could embarrass FDR.<note place="foot" n="72"

                        insignificant documents that reflected poorly on Roosevelt’s decisions and
                        ignored more significant ones that didn’t. He complained that the
                        compilation obscured the influence of Alger Hiss by scattering his papers
                        throughout the volume rather than collecting them in a discrete section. He
                        doubted that Noble and Franklin had exhausted all their options to examine
                        papers controlled by the Stettinius estate and James F. Byrnes (who had
                        attended the Yalta summit as the Director of the Office of War Mobilization
                        and Reconversion). He felt betrayed when Dulles postponed publication until
                        after the 1954 midterm elections. With each allegation, Noble and Franklin
                        carefully documented the substance and rationale for their decisions to
                        guard against Barron’s continual appeals to Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                        State for Public Affairs Robinson McIlvaine, Assistant Secretary McCardle,

                        release of the Yalta Papers, Noble found the prospect of academic oversight
                        a useful buffer against continued congressional scrutiny. He cooperated with
                        the AHA and other professional organizations as they inquired about the
                        status of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> in 1955. In early 1956, Noble
                        contacted noted diplomatic historian Dexter Perkins, then President of the
                        AHA, to propose that the academic community institutionalize its engagement
                        with HD and <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> into a permanent advisory committee.
                        Noble explained that “in this day and time, when the number of diplomatic
                        papers has reached such gigantic proportions, the task of compiling <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> has become inordinately
                        complicated.” He elaborated that the Historical Division “would welcome
                        highly qualified professional advice from the outside” on “a number of
                        problems involving the scope of the selection of the papers, the nature of
                        the contents of the volumes, and the inadequacy of State Department files to

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1194"/>Throughout the rest of the year, HD cultivated
                        academic and Department support for an advisory committee. Noble’s efforts
                        with private scholars and professional organizations representing
                        historians, political scientists, and international lawyers proceeded
                        relatively smoothly over the course of 1956 and 1957. The American
                        Historical Association, the American Society of International Law, and the
                        American Political Science Association nominated candidates for service on
                        the Historical Advisory Committee (HAC), and HD selected the nominees who
                        were subsequently invited to join the Committee by the Assistant Secretary
                        of State for Public Affairs. The HAC members received security clearances in
                        line with existing Department procedures for granting access to unreleased
                        (and potentially sensitive) information to approved “serious”

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_897"/>Within the Department, progress was smooth until the
                        eve of the first HAC meeting, when Dulles grew “fearful that we were
                        creating a group who would only put pressure on us for earlier and more full
                        publication despite contrary foreign policy effects.” Over the previous
                        year, Noble had secured support from Robert Murphy, the Deputy Under
                        Secretary of State for Political Affairs as well as officials in the Public
                        Affairs, Administration, and Legal Affairs Bureaus by claiming that “the
                        advice of eminent private scholars who use the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> volumes would be of real use to the Historical Division”
                        in answering increasingly thorny questions of the proper scope and
                        organization of the series. He also anticipated that an advisory committee
                        would “provide an excellent liaison between the Department’s historical
                        functions and the scholarly world” and become a “valuable asset from the
                        point of view of the Department’s public relations.” Though Dulles was less
                        sanguine about the Committee’s potential value to the Department, he
                        recognized that the Department “could not backtrack on the decision to
                        utilize an advisory committee.” Participants at Dulles’s October 30, 1957
                        staff meeting concluded that the challenge facing HD and the Department as a
                        whole was to “explore” the “nature of its activities” and “steer” the new
                        HAC in “the most constructive direction.”<note place="foot" n="80"

                        Northwestern University diplomatic historian selected to serve on the HAC,
                        consulted with George F. Kennan, the celebrated U.S. diplomat and former
                        Director of the Policy Planning Staff, about the future of the series.
                        Leopold expressed concern that the Department was poorly equipped to broaden
                        the scope of documentation beyond its own records or protect itself from
                        “charge[s] of selectivity and intentional distortion or suppression.” He
                        wondered if “the time has come to take the compilation of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series out of the hands of the
                        Department of State and make it the responsibility of some
                        inter-departmental agency.” Kennan, in turn, sought advice from British
                        historian and diplomatic documentary editor Llewellyn Woodward and future
                        philanthropic administrator Gerald Freund. After corresponding with these
                        colleagues, Kennan agreed that the scope of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> had
                        to be broadened beyond Department of State records to provide an “adequate”
                        account of U.S. foreign policy. To achieve this, he suggested that the
                        Department hand the project over to a “semi-private academic unit” that
                        would limit coverage to “subjects or episodes of major importance.” Kennan
                        also urged that “special precautions” be taken “to assure the high scholarly
                        capability, wisdom, and integrity . . . of those to whom this really great
                        responsibility would be given.” Major academic organizations like the
                        American Historical Association and the Council of Learned Societies, he
                        concluded, should determine “who would be entrusted with this work.”<note

                        complete volumes, but comprehensiveness entailed significant delays for
                        access and clearance. Despite his skepticism about the Committee, Dulles

                        regarded the HAC as a source of cover from partisan pressures, of guidance
                        for adapting the series to a new Cold War era, and of leverage in
                        bureaucratic battles over declassification.</p>
                    <p>The formation of the HAC confirmed <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s shift from
                        19th century practices that linked the series to Congress toward a 20th
                        century historical transparency regime reflecting scholarly expectations for
                        comprehensive disclosure. Over time, the HAC gained significant
                        institutional power. During the Cold War, the Committee helped to shape the
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series and regulate the balance
                        between national security and governmental transparency. Over the following
                        decades, the HAC joined policymakers and Department of State historians as
                        they struggled to renegotiate responsible historical transparency and to
                        accelerate the production of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>

                        the Department of State published <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes
                        covering the years 1940 through 1951, a key period of transformation in U.S.
                        foreign policy. In doing so, Department historians grappled with daunting,
                        but familiar, challenges. Resource and access constraints forced the
                        Historical Office (HO) and the Historical Advisory Committee (HAC) to make
                        difficult decisions about how to balance the comprehensiveness, timeliness,
                        and affordability of the series. Clearance difficulties disrupted production
                        schedules and undermined efforts to accelerate the series. As HO and HAC
                        dealt with these issues, their choices defined new norms for the scope,
                        selectivity, and timeliness of the series.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1146"/>During these two decades, <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi>’s scope expanded to incorporate the most significant records
                        of high-level decisionmaking in the U.S. Government. This extension of
                        coverage was by no means assured in 1958. Taking into account recent
                        difficulties in securing access to military records for the Yalta
                        compilation and to files held in the Truman Presidential Library for the
                        Potsdam volumes, the Historical Division (HD) and the HAC agreed in 1958
                        that research for regular <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes should focus
                        almost exclusively on the Department of State’s central files. Although the
                        HAC reconsidered this stance in the early 1960s, HO continued to limit
                        “supplemental” research until the 1970s, when <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        compilers began systematically exploiting Presidential Library holdings.
                        Although continuing access restrictions for CIA and JCS records frustrated
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilers, they made the most of their new
                        opportunities to document high-level decisionmaking during the early Cold
                        War.</p>
                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_1505-start" corresp="#b_1505-end"/>
                        <anchor xml:id="b_1702"/>This high-level focus was itself another
                        development for the series. Confronted with a growing universe of
                        documentation related to U.S. foreign policy as the series moved to the
                        postwar era, HO and the HAC had to devise new editorial strategies to
                        sustain the quality of the volumes with constrained human and financial
                        resources. Maintaining previous thresholds of inclusion would have required
                        vastly increased appropriations for staff and printing, which in turn would
                        have caused additional delays in declassifying a growing number of
                        documents. At the same time, academic consumers of the series still relied
                        on the volumes to provide a reliable foundation for research and teaching.
                        Despite increasing numbers of ever-thicker volumes, the “<hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> filter” grew progressively finer as compilers employed
                        increasingly selective criteria in choosing which records to print. As HO
                        and the HAC maintained the principle of comprehensive coverage (rejecting
                        alternatives like omitting documentation of “lesser” countries or by
                        printing final policy decisions without records of the process that led to
                        their approval), they gravitated toward a new vision for the series. Instead
                        of focusing upon diplomatic correspondence incorporating final policy
                        decisions, which had been <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s core function during
                        its first hundred years of existence, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> focused on
                        U.S. Government decisionmaking. This necessarily reduced the proportion of
                        the volumes devoted to instructions from the Department and reports from
                        posts. It also resulted in sharply diminished documentation of international
                        law topics, which had been prioritized in the interwar period.<note

                        with triennial compilations. By 1979, the series had largely shifted from
                        documenting diplomacy to documenting policymaking.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_506"/>Finally, discussions concerning timeliness that
                        unfolded between 1958 and 1978 revealed evolving conceptions about the
                        purpose of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. At first, HO sought to restore the
                        “traditional” 15-year line that held for the interwar era. The first
                        Presidential directive for the series, issued by John F. Kennedy in 1961,
                        endorsed this goal, but the series consistently fell short of the target.
                        Throughout the remainder of the 1960s, HO management and the HAC lobbied for
                        expanded resources to accelerate the series to meet a compromise 20-year
                        deadline. They warned the Department leadership that the inaccessibility of
                        the historical record nurtured deeply flawed “revisionist” interpretations
                        of the origins of the Cold War. Overcoming this phenomenon, they suggested,
                        could deflate the anti-Vietnam War movement, placate unrest on college
                        campuses, and reduce other burdens plaguing contemporary policymakers. After
                        Walter LaFeber, a leading Cold War revisionist historian, joined the HAC in
                        1971, this rationale for accelerating <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        disappeared completely. Instead, the HAC emphasized the crucial role that
                        the production of the series played in the larger declassification process
                        for Department of State records. The Department’s traditional release
                        procedures for its increasingly voluminous files had become hopelessly
                        inadequate. The 1966 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), introduced as an
                        alternative, produced minimal results. Even when Congress strengthened FOIA
                        in 1974, it remained costly and time-consuming to implement, and yielded
                        inconsistent outcomes. To avoid FOIA’s inefficiencies, transparency
                        advocates urged the Department to accelerate the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series as an effective way to promote earlier public
                        access to a much larger body of records. To this end, President Richard
                        Nixon ordered the acceleration of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to a 20-year
                        line in 1972.<anchor xml:id="b_1505-end" corresp="#b_1505-start"/>

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_449"/>Nixon’s directive inspired a new HO management team,
                        led by David Trask, to embark upon an ambitious plan to streamline
                        production, consolidate volumes into triennial compilations, and employ new
                        computer and microform technologies in the mid-1970s. By the late 1970s,
                        Trask’s acceleration plan generated friction with the staff and the HAC.
                        Between 1958 and 1979, HO and the HAC defined new norms for the <hi

                        encountered with the Yalta volume persisted: accounting for the rising
                        importance of Presidential documentation outside the control of the
                        Department, the growing necessity of mining the Department’s decentralized
                        files (often described as “lot files”), the increasing importance of
                        other-agency documentation (and clearances), and, for some volumes,
                        heightened political and diplomatic sensitivities that complicated
                        declassification and invited congressional scrutiny. New difficulties arose
                        as well, especially as <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> moved into the postwar
                        era. After 1945, the United Nations, the National Security Council, the
                        Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and alliance
                        commitments like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization all came into
                        existence, enlarging the scope of U.S. diplomatic activity while also
                        diminishing the Department of State’s already circumscribed authority over

                        occupied the early years of the HAC. At the first Committee meeting in
                        December 1957, Noble asked members for advice about two critical questions
                        facing HD: should <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> maintain its existing
                        standards of coverage in the face of a looming explosion of relevant
                        documentation, and should <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians supplement
                        the records of the Department of State with files belonging to other
                        agencies in the burgeoning national security bureaucracy? In dealing with
                        the former, the challenge facing HD and the HAC was to balance competing
                        priorities. The series could not possibly provide the same level of
                        documentation that it had in the past, given resource constraints and the
                        vast expansion of source material. Yet <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> also had
                        to continue to meet the needs of its consumers, especially those in the
                        academic community. As the first chair of the Committee, Dexter Perkins,
                        noted, “more than ever . . . we have to establish criteria of what is really
                        of most use because most students could not go to the Archives” and instead
                        relied on <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> for source material.<note place="foot"

                        dilemma for the modern series: how to balance thoroughness and timeliness in
                        a process continually disrupted by access and clearance complications. HD
                        proposed a range of options, including: <list rend="bulleted">
                            <item>“tighten up on the present basis of selection,”</item>
                            <item>“narrow the range of topics to be covered,”</item>
                            <item>“abandon the present comprehensive coverage . . . and concentrate

                        </list> Although individual HAC members at times suggested abandoning
                        coverage of “minor countries,” the Committee’s 1958 report urged HD to focus
                        its efforts on refining and narrowing its existing selection criteria rather
                        than dramatically restricting the scope of the series.<note place="foot"

                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to avoid the frustrating access restrictions and
                        bruising interagency clearance debates that delayed the wartime conference
                        volumes. While it was clear to everyone that those special volumes required
                        substantial military documentation, the question remained “how much of an
                        effort [HD] should make in normal circumstances to get the papers of [other
                        agencies],” which involved “a great deal of difficulty in getting clearance
                        and getting access.” William Franklin, the Deputy Chief of HD, warned that
                        the Division’s efforts to declassify the accelerated China volumes suggested
                        that documenting the operation of the National Security Council would “be a
                        real problem.” In view of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s Departmental mandate
                        to provide the “official record of the foreign policy of the United States,”
                        HAC member Philip Thayer concluded that “you have got to chase down
                        significant documents wherever you have to go to get them.” The immediate
                        question facing HD and the HAC was whether <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        compilers should limit their interagency research requests to documentary
                        threads that began within Department of State records or whether they should
                        seek to “dig out . . . papers from other agencies.” HAC member Richard
                        Leopold urged that, however this question was resolved, the Department
                        clearly elucidate its research and editorial policies and procedures to
                        readers of the volumes. The HAC’s final report determined that “it would not
                        be practicable to range far afield in preparing [<hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi>] for publication” and recommended limiting the series, which was
                        “by origin and nature a State Department record,” to internal Department

                        broader range of source material, including documentation of intelligence
                            operations.<note place="foot" n="6" xml:id="chapter-8fn6">“Report of the

                            prepared a short explanation of how compilers relied on annotation to
                            provide citations to already-published material or summarize significant
                            information from less essential documents, thereby reducing the number
                            of documents that they needed to print in full in a given volume.
                            Perkins also explained that this device saved space, but greatly added
                            to the time required to prepare a volume. See Perkins memorandum,

                        the introduction of the NSC process had actually improved the Department’s
                        awareness (and record) of “the activities of other agencies in the foreign

                        extensive analysis of “Problems of Compiling <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> for the Years 1946–1950,” prepared after Berdahl’s report
                        and before the 1961 HAC meeting, Perkins argued that interagency access was
                        less important than it had been for the war years since “the Department of
                        State again moved into its natural position as the prime agency in the field
                        of international affairs.” Perkins acknowledged that the series would
                        “continue to need supplementary documentation for files outside the
                        Department,” but he also argued that research beyond Department of State
                        records would quickly run into “a law of diminishing returns” that yielded
                        records of “marginal value.” Perkins envisioned that compilers would focus
                        their attention on the Department of State central files and only turn to
                        the Department’s own decentralized files or other-agency records when they
                        encountered “significant gaps” in the record. He also hoped to focus
                        supplemental research at the Truman Library as the “chief outside source,”
                        noting “it is urgently necessary to establish good working relations there
                        in order to obtain the needed papers.” In response to Berdahl’s advice to
                        include intelligence materials in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, Perkins
                        warned that intelligence activities would be very difficult to document and
                        predicted that the series would be “fortunate” if it were allowed to release
                        sanitized intelligence-related documents “needed for the understanding of a
                        policy decision.” Citing the bureaucratic primacy of the Department of State
                        in defining Truman’s foreign policy, Perkins rationalized maintaining the
                        status quo for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilation methodology.<note

                        Only those possessing “a very considerable expertise in intelligence” could
                        evaluate the risks of releasing specific intelligence-related information.
                        Previous disclosure was irrelevant since “two wrongs do not make a right”
                        and “the harm done by repeated publication tends, up to a point, to increase
                        by a geometric ratio with each new disclosure.” Noble’s examples of prior
                        releases were even more problematic because they “were made by individuals,
                        not by Government agencies. This is not at all the same thing as their
                        disclosure in an official publication by the Department of State—which would
                        provide the most solemn and incontrovertible of evidence, thus far lacking.”
                        Finally, the Chief for Foreign Intelligence warned Dulles that “the more the
                        United States Government officially reveals of its clandestine activities in
                        the past, the more difficult it is likely to become to recruit personnel for
                        such activities in the future.”<note place="foot" n="20"

                        substance of many clearance decisions reflected Cold War fears and
                        objectives. Department officers worried that publishing official documents
                        reflecting historical criticism of important partners would embarrass
                        current relations and demoralize anti-Communist allies. These anxieties
                        reflected the Department’s experience with the first installments of the
                        special subseries of accelerated China volumes covering the 1940s requested
                        alongside the wartime conference volumes by Sen. William Knowland in 1953.
                        In 1956, the Department postponed release of the already-printed 1941 Far
                        East volume after receiving protests from Max Bishop, the U.S. Ambassador in
                        Bangkok. Although officials in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs (FE) had
                        previously cleared the compilation, they supported Bishop’s claims that
                        releasing 15-year-old reports of Thai collaboration with Japan and
                        expansionist designs against Cambodia and Laos could endanger the political
                        standing of pro-American Thai officials and disrupt U.S. efforts to mobilize
                        regional support for containing revolutionary nationalism in Southeast

                        years. In 1959, Assistant Secretary of State for FE Graham Parsons explained
                        to a skeptical HAC that releasing the volume “would be exploited by the
                        Cambodians, it would be exploited by the Communist bloc, and it would be to
                        the detriment of an important free world ally whose capital is also the
                        center of the South East Asia Treaty Organization, on which the collective
                        security arrangements of the area depend.” In 1961, Arthur Schlesinger,
                        Special Assistant to President Kennedy, brought White House pressure to bear
                        in favor of releasing the embargoed volumes during HAC discussions with FE
                        officials about the 1941 Far East volume (and the 1943 China volume). The
                        volumes were released the following spring.<note place="foot" n="29"

                        difficulties. During most of the 1960s, the Department was reluctant to
                        exacerbate official and unofficial Nationalist Chinese resentment over
                        publication of the 1949 White Paper. Indeed, reporting from Taipei in 1967
                        indicated that “the average Chinese official or scholar cannot understand
                        why a work such as [<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>] should ever be published
                        unless it is designed to serve some political objective of the publishers.
                        The concept that an academic community could bring sufficient pressure on a
                        government to force it to reveal sensitive information gets little
                        credence.” In an effort to depoliticize the China volumes, the Department
                        delayed their publication so that they could be released alongside the
                        regular annual volumes covering the 1940s rather than as a special,
                        accelerated subseries. By the late 1960s, however, the Department grew more
                        anxious about Beijing’s reaction to publication than Taipei’s.<note

                            gutted that the reader would scarcely be aware of the existence of the
                            Italian Communist Party.” He advised that “if we cannot secure
                            reconsideration of this wholesale slaughter, I would certainly be
                            obliged to recommend the excision of the entire [1948 Italian]
                            compilation. To print what would be permitted by the desk would simply
                            amount to a fraud. We have never been guilty of that!” By 1973, the
                            Bureau of European Affairs reduced its excisions to allow HO “to present
                            the main lines of American policy quite clearly and directly,” albeit

                        press coverage frequently misconstrued the U.S. Government’s motives in
                        publishing historical documents. For example, in 1973, the U.S. Embassy in
                        Costa Rica reported “a surprisingly widespread perplexity and lack of
                        understanding as to how the documents came to be published.” Many U.S.
                        diplomats would have agreed with their colleagues in San José that “we do

                        the one hand, HO and the HAC wanted the volumes to be as comprehensive as
                        feasible. Only robust documentation of decisionmaking within the Department
                        and between the Department and other constituents of a burgeoning national
                        security establishment would allow <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to continue
                        providing an objective and contextualized account of U.S. foreign policy.
                        Unfortunately, the arduous steps needed to access and clear the records
                        entailed, at a minimum, significant delay in the production of <hi

                        controversy and as the Department deliberated about the release of the
                        Potsdam and Cairo-Tehran wartime conference volumes, Deputy Under Secretary
                        of State for Political Affairs Robert Murphy asked HD about the <hi

                        claims for the primacy of security against transparency for these
                        controversial additions to the series, he wanted to know more about the

                        volumes. In response, Noble explained that, although “a general presumption
                        that [<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>] should be published within a 15-year
                        period” prevailed in the 1930s and into the 1940s, “the impact of World War
                        II, resulting in a great increase in the bulk and sensitivity of our
                        diplomatic documentation, coupled with insufficiency of staff, caused the
                        lag to lengthen to 18 years” by the early 1950s. He also warned that “there
                        are prominent and influential people in the public, and especially in
                        Congress . . . who feel that a gap of even 15 years cannot be justified.”
                        Noble urged that even if it proved “impossible for the Department to publish
                        the record of its diplomacy within 15 years . . . every effort should be
                        made to prevent a further widening of the gap.”<note place="foot" n="46"

                        production. In lieu of defined systematic declassification review
                        procedures, the Department of State used <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        compilations to provide responsible officials in the various operational
                        bureaus with a representative sample of the historically-significant record
                        to review for publication. Clearance decisions for information in <hi

                        larger mass of the Department’s unpublished records. These procedures
                        resulted in a trifurcated transparency regime: the Department transferred 30
                        year-old documents to NARA, where they were open to the public; records for
                        which related <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes had not yet been published
                        remained closed; and HO administered “qualified” unofficial researcher

                        volume had been published but were less than 30 years old. According to the

                        were U.S. citizens and passed a “security name check” could consult

                            Publication several years ago of the 1945, 1946[,] and 1947 volumes

                        and “a mounting anti-historical and future-minded spirit abroad in the

                        Elmer Plischke lamented the “slippage” in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        publication that “cause[d] the Department and the nation grave harm” by
                        inviting “irresponsible members of the public . . . to charge the government

                        “the undesirable gap between the Department and the scholarly community.”
                        With sufficient resources, Plischke argued, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        could become a valuable instrument of shaping public opinion by refuting

                        was not going away. In 1971, the Department invited Walter LaFeber, a
                        leading revisionist historian of U.S. foreign relations, to represent the

                        HAC noted that “there is a lively interest in the declassification and
                        publication of documents relating to foreign affairs to be found throughout

                        attempt to implement Nixon’s directive. Office management determined that,
                        even reinforced with planned additional resources and spurred by tightened
                        deadlines, HO staff could not produce traditional annual volumes quickly
                        enough to meet the 20-year publication line. To balance resources and
                        objectives, Fredrick Aandahl, Gleason’s successor as the General Editor of
                        the series,<note place="foot" n="66" xml:id="chapter-8fn66">Aandahl replaced

                        consolidate coverage by converting the series from an annual to a triennial
                        format. In the face of HAC skepticism of the need to limit the size the
                        series, David Trask, Franklin’s successor as HO office director, developed a
                        plan in 1976 to complete three full triennial subseries (for 1952–1954,
                        1955–1957, and 1958–1960) in four years to meet Nixon’s deadline by 1980.
                        The acceleration initiatives of the mid- and late 1970s introduced many
                        reforms that HO and the HAC continued to employ in later years. Trask’s
                        plan—and its failure—prefigured the limited success of subsequent efforts to
                        improve <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> timeliness.</p>

                        that “we will get to a 20-year line within the next several years” and he
                        jestingly anticipated “count[ing] [this accomplishment] as a contribution to
                        the Bicentennial.” He explained that HO was “able to buy priority service at
                        the Government Printing Office,” which resulted in the printing of 11
                        volumes during 1972 (“an all-time high”). This arrangement enabled progress
                        against the backlog rather than early progress on the vital “initial and
                        middle stages of our long assembly line,” which would be “the real basis for
                        a sustained, speedier production.” Nonetheless, it did raise hopes of
                        eliminating one perennial source of delay for the series. At the same time,
                        Franklin warned the Committee that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> would “not be
                        able to include documentation on covert intelligence, least of all if the

                        Aandahl devised an “optimal program” for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        production to implement Franklin’s pledge. At the 1973 annual HAC meeting,
                        he announced that HO had “reached our full authorized strength and our new
                        members have completed their initial period of training and
                        familiarization.” To meet acceleration targets, however, HO staff would have
                        to surpass previous performance records and “compile seven volumes [covering
                        one year] in about seven months.” Even with “a bright and energetic team
                        that will rise to a challenge,” this was a tall order.<note place="foot"

                        <anchor xml:id="b_587"/>Within weeks, Aandahl recognized that additional
                        resources would be required to make progress toward the 20-year line. To
                        meet Nixon’s deadline, he informed Assistant Secretary of State for Public
                        Affairs Carol Laise that HO would have to complete compilation at an 18-year
                        line (rather than the 22-year line that it currently met). To catch up, HO
                        compilers would need to complete 12–14 volumes a year—twice the normal
                        output—until the gap was closed. Aandahl explained that his augmented staff
                        of 14 compiler-historians and three branch chief supervisors could not meet
                        this requirement and that at least three more compilers would be needed to
                        reach the 20-year line. He also asked for permission to incorporate
                        editorial staff from elsewhere in the Department into HO to reduce delays in
                        resolving the many substantive and technical questions that arose during
                        production. Finally, Aandahl urged PA to upgrade HO facilities and increase
                        travel funds needed for “occasional” research trips to the Truman and
                        Eisenhower Presidential Libraries.<note place="foot" n="70"

                            catalyze PA engagement in HO. In October 1974, Frank Wisner and Carol
                            Laise directed HO to undertake a comprehensive review of its purposes
                            and functions. HO organized two committees to undertake a bottom-up
                            examination of the Office’s activities and organization. Many of the
                            committees’ recommendations informed the acceleration and reorganization
                            initiatives that followed. See Wisner to Laise, October 23, 1974;
                            Committee “O” of the Historical Office to Laise, November 27, 1974;

                            reported to the HAC that “lack of money had not caused major delay in
                            the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Printing funds had
                            been adequate, and the delays had come from clearance difficulties.”
                            Aandahl clarified that “the severest pinch was felt in the small
                            editorial staff of the Publishing and Reproduction Division,” which was
                            in the Bureau of Administration. A few days after the Committee meeting,
                            Aandahl elaborated: “in the two years since the [acceleration] directive
                            was issued . . . the Department has added three historians to the staff
                            [and] provided additional funds for printing and binding.” See minutes

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_1525-start" corresp="#b_1525-end"/>Aandahl also proposed a
                        strategy to mitigate clearance delays in 1974. He recommended that the
                        Office channel publication of especially sensitive materials into a special
                        supplemental volume. Such a volume would consolidate “problem documents . .
                        . and allow us to make great strides toward the 20-year line, while at the
                        same time preserving the long-term integrity and comprehensive nature of the
                        series.” Aandahl recognized that creating a new “deferred” category of
                        release “might encourage reviewing officers to put too much” into it, but he
                        hoped to avoid this prospect by keeping his plan secret from his colleagues
                        in the U.S. Government. Retrospective volumes could be HO’s “secret escape
                        hatch, allowing us to decide on our own terms which issues we wish to make a
                        stand on. Under the present system, whenever we delete a document it is
                        virtually lost to the series forever, and this forces us into an absolutist
                        position that is highly destructive of rational scheduling.” Aandahl never
                        explained how knowledge of this editorial triaging could be disseminated to
                        the academic community but withheld from the rest of the U.S. Government.
                        The HAC (publicly) endorsed this strategy, as a last resort, in its annual
                        report following the 1974 meeting.<note place="foot" n="72"

                        strategy for accelerating <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        compilation: shifting from annual to triennial volumes. At the 1974 HAC
                        meeting, Aandahl admitted that the “even with increased productivity”—which
                        had tripled since 1971—“<hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> was not
                        making sufficiently rapid progress toward the twenty-year line.” To address
                        the persisting compilation chasm, HO had “adopted a triennial format for the
                        1952–1954 volumes,” which would “boost morale,” allow for “more intensive
                        planning of the series,” and enable the Office to address “major clearance
                        problems in an early and rational manner.”<note place="foot" n="73"

                            HAC Lot File 96D292, Box 2, 1974–Minutes.</note> In a follow-up letter
                        to HAC Chair Walter LaFeber, Aandahl explained that the triennial plan was a
                        necessary “drastic action.” By “reduc[ing] duplication, improv[ing]
                        efficiency, and sharpen[ing] the focus of the series,” consolidating
                        coverage offered the “most feasible way to catch up.” Converting volumes
                        covering the period 1952–1960 to the triennial format, Aandahl projected,
                        would allow HO to reach the 18-year compilation line by 1978. He also
                        promised that triennial compilations would increase the quality of the
                        series by enabling “keener judgments on selection of documents.” Employing a
                        market metaphor, he explained that “competition is tougher, and this is
                        producing better stories.” Aandahl asked LaFeber and the Committee to “allow
                        [HO] some leeway in how we organize our work, both in compilation and in
                        clearance. We have some excellent volumes in process, we have gained
                        considerable momentum on the operations that are within our direct control,
                        and I feel that it would be a great pity to break our stride at this
                            point.”<note place="foot" n="74" xml:id="chapter-8fn74">Aandahl to

                    <p>The HAC sharply criticized the triennial plan in its 1974 annual report. The
                        Committee lamented that the reduction would “work hardship on those unable
                        to travel to Washington to use the files” and “hinder the many teachers who
                        rely upon <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> for classroom purposes.”
                        It also worried that consolidation could “lead to the mere presentation of
                        final policy decisions . . . too much like an official ‘White Paper.’” The
                        HAC feared triennial compilations would “worsen the clearance problem” by
                        ensnaring three years of material whenever HO appealed unfavorable
                        declassification decisions. Finally, the triennial plan seemed to constrain
                        space in the series for important “general” and thematic topics that
                        promised to grow in importance in the post-1947 era. The HAC urged that “no
                        internal, non-scholarly criteria should force changes” that would jeopardize
                        “the quality, reputation, and usefulness of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi>.” The HAC wanted <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to be
                        accelerated as it was, not transformed into something easier to
                            produce.<note place="foot" n="75" xml:id="chapter-8fn75">Report of 1974

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1147"/>In August, Trask and the HO management team also
                        finalized an acceleration plan to realize a 20-year clearance line by 1980.
                        The plan called for “increasing the scope of materials included in the
                        series to make [<hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>] the primary
                        vehicle for declassifying the most important documents of all major
                        government agencies relating to foreign policy and diplomacy.” Trask
                        confirmed the shift to triennial volumes and asked HO staff to complete the
                        compilation of the ten remaining volumes in the 1952–1954 subseries by
                        December (six had already been compiled), a 12-volume 1955–1957 subseries by
                        the end of the summer of 1978, and a 12-volume 1958–1960 subseries by “early
                        1980.” “Team compiling” would “speed up the work” and produce “volumes in a
                        steady and predictable sequence.” Trask also envisioned that clearing
                        documents in manuscript (rather than typeset galley proofs) could allow for
                        “early and continuous declassification . . . even as compilation [went]
                            forward.”<note place="foot" n="82" xml:id="chapter-8fn82">For

                        that the stated objectives of the acceleration plan conflicted with one
                        another. “An energetic effort to widen the scope of our coverage,” he
                        warned, “may significantly interfere with our goal of a twenty-year line by
                        1980.” Kane predicted that reducing the number of documents sent to the
                        Pentagon for declassification would prove less important than “the content
                        of the documents” referred. He also cautioned against relying on anticipated
                        technological panaceas, especially those that would actually be implemented
                        outside HO. Real improvements in HO’s efficiency could be realized, Kane

                        Blair urged Kissinger to “strengthen the series” by requesting President
                        Gerald Ford’s endorsement of “the series’ mission . . . to ensure full
                        cooperation of other agencies” to “improve[e] its substantive coverage of

                        an increasingly alienated staff, a wary HAC, and a suspicious academic
                        community of the benefits of his acceleration plan. In November 1977, Slany
                        explained (in an undistributed memorandum for the files) that staff
                        discontent reflected alienation from HO decisionmaking, skepticism of
                        Trask’s efforts at “inreach” within the Department, resentment of his
                        “negative sometimes contemptuous attitude toward the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> series as a publication and an occupation,”
                        suspicion of a “conservative approach to disclosure” obscured by
                        “lip-service to the principle of ‘openness,’” and bitterness at the
                        “demolition of the Historical Studies function of the Office.” Slany
                        believed the staff’s professional consciousness trumped its bureaucratic
                        identity and its fixation on substantive matters ignored administrative
                            priorities.<note place="foot" n="100" xml:id="chapter-8fn100">No author

                        eliminate unnecessary federal advisory committees threatened the HAC with
                        termination, Trask and his superiors in the Bureau of Public Affairs fought
                        to preserve the Committee. In March and April, HO and PA effectively rallied
                        academic community support for the HAC. Deputy Assistant Secretary Blair
                        told his new boss, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Hodding
                        Carter, that the Committee’s “substantive” role in “keeping the series
                        honest, and seen as such” filled a “compelling” need “in these days of high
                        expectations of openness and participation.” Former Secretary of State Dean
                        Rusk likewise supported the Committee’s role in helping the U.S. Government
                        “open up its archives.” At a sparsely attended April 8 public hearing on the
                        matter, Trask and Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary William Dyess assured
                        members of the Department’s Management Operations staff (which oversaw the
                        activities of the Department’s various advisory committees) that the HAC
                        served a vital function “promoting openness and communications” between the
                        academic community and the U.S. Government. By October, Trask could report
                        to Rusk that President Jimmy Carter had “approved [the Committee’s]

                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> in two principal ways in 1978. First, scholars
                        lobbied Senator George McGovern (D–SD) to introduce language in the
                        Department’s authorizing legislation that required future <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes to “maintain the high standard of comprehensive
                        documentation already established by past volumes.” A conference committee
                        report clarified that this language meant that HO should “consult fully with
                        scholars in diplomacy and other fields, university and other libraries, and
                        interested members of the public about the most appropriate method of
                        publishing the series in the future.” The report also expressed Congress’s
                        “expectation” that HO would “consult formally” with House and Senate
                        committees before changing selection standards or publishing format.<note

                        concern was the formation of a “shadow HAC” within the Society for
                        Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR) at the end of 1977. SHAFR
                        assigned this “ad hoc committee” a remit “to explore the question of the
                        future content and format of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        series.” Current and former HAC members and leading diplomatic historians in
                        SHAFR hoped the shadow HAC could buttress the official Committee. After the
                        1978 meeting, HAC members Lloyd Gardner and Betty Unterberger asked for the
                        shadow HAC’s assistance. In April, Unterberger, Gardner, Richard Leopold,
                        and William Appleman Williams met to discuss recent <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> developments. The ad hoc committee lamented declining Office
                        morale and agreed that the McGovern amendment had a salutary effect on
                        restraining potentially harmful HO actions. They singled out Trask’s
                        microform initiative as potentially corrosive to the series. Although
                        appreciative of his efforts to share information with the HAC, the committee
                        urged Trask to expand this outreach to the rest of the interested academic
                            community.<note place="foot" n="109" xml:id="chapter-8fn109">Wayne Cole,

                    <p>By the end of the 1970s, efforts to accelerate production had alienated
                        critical <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> stakeholders. As HO staff, HO
                        management, and the HAC debated the best ways to accelerate and improve the
                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, they lost confidence in
                        one another. Trask and other HO managers wanted the academic community to
                        trust their judgment and integrity. They also wanted the staff to implement
                        management decisions without second-guessing their authority or wisdom. HO
                        staff resented authoritarian management in the guise of reform and remained
                        suspicious of Trask’s commitment to openness. The HAC wanted HO to improve
                        the timeliness of the series without jeopardizing its comprehensiveness by
                        resorting to experiments in triennial consolidation or microform

                    <p>Between 1958 and 1978, the Department of State published 92 <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes. During this period, the publication lag grew by
                        almost 50 percent, from 19 years between 1958 and 1963 to 27 years between
                        1973 and 1978. Although the timeliness of the series suffered, HO historians
                        made significant breakthroughs in access to records outside the Department
                        of State. Exploiting this documentation required <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        historians to improve existing interagency relationships and forge new ones.
                        Despite these qualitative improvements, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        stakeholders debated how to balance timeliness, thoroughness, and
                        comprehensiveness in the mid-1970s. These conflicts divided HO management,
                        HO staff, and the HAC just before the Department grew less hospitable to
                        responsible historical transparency in 1980.</p>

                        years. The 27 volumes published after 1980 reflected a major clash between
                        Department historians and a new Departmental Classification/Declassification
                        Center (CDC) in 1980 and 1981. The creation of the CDC in 1978 introduced a
                        powerful, focused bureaucratic counterweight to HO and fostered an
                        institutional culture skeptical of transparency within the Department. The

                        series. Anxious Department officials insisted that the CDC review again all
                        18 unpublished <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilations that had been
                        cleared under the old decentralized declassification procedures. HO’s

                        In early 1981, the Department adopted procedures to expand foreign
                        government information (FGI) consultations and transferred interagency <hi

                        concerns over the U.S. Government’s responsibility for openness throughout
                        the rest of the decade. Amidst delays in securing adequate clearance for
                        existing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> manuscripts, HO halted further
                        compilation for over a year in the early 1980s. One re-reviewed volume, The
                        American Republics, 1952–1954, lacked documentation of the CIA’s
                        widely-known role in deposing Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala when it was
                        published at the end of 1983. In 1984, as Nixon’s mandated 20-year line
                        seemed increasingly unattainable, the Department rejected academic community
                        requests to hold <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to a 25-year line and instead
                        established a 30-year norm. Even meeting a 30-year line required President
                        Ronald Reagan’s intervention to order an acceleration of the production
                        process. Most critically, the re-review decision led HO to lower its
                        expectations for comprehensiveness and the HAC to focus its attention on
                        declassification policy and procedures, which brought it into conflict with
                        an increasingly assertive CDC as the Department implemented the Reagan

                            from 19 or 20 years up to (but not including) 30 years, we have a hybrid
                            of clearance criteria under E.O. 12065. It’s messy and unfortunate, but
                            it’s a fact. Anything defined as US government material is going to be
                            reviewed under systematic review criteria. Anything defined as FGI

                        function and the Department must organize itself to handle them on a
                        permanent basis.” To implement Carter’s directive, Read established “a
                        unified Department-wide structure governing all aspects of records release.”
                        The Classification/Declassification Center (CDC) replaced the ad hoc process
                        of clearances by desk officers in the geographic and functional bureaus,
                        whose prioritization of operational responsibilities sometimes led to tardy
                        or arbitrary decisions about releasing information. The transition to CDC

                        transition to the new declassification regime fell apart after CDC and
                        Bureau of European Affairs (EUR) officials protested that the old clearance
                        process failed to protect sensitive material in several <hi rend="italic"

                        EUR’s concerns since the Bureau had presented vexing clearance problems in
                        recent years. In 1978, HO declassification adviser David Baehler warned his
                        superiors that EUR “requested large deletions in major compilations for 1951
                        and 1952–54” involving two types of information: “U.S. planning on political
                        or propaganda action to be undertaken covertly or semi-covertly . . .
                        includ[ing] any mention of CIA as an agency responsible for such action” and
                        “material that . . . might . . . give offense to another government and
                        thereby impair U.S. relations with it.” He emphasized that EUR’s excisions
                        were “not small potatoes. The covert activities category . . . is a
                        significant aspect of U.S. policy for the early 1950s. We might as well face
                        the fact now that our acceding to bureau requests that this category not be
                        treated in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> would be tantamount to
                        the purposeful omission of a considerable body of the foreign policy
                        record.” Baehler warned that accepting EUR deletions would “set a precedent
                        for a long time to come.”<note place="foot" n="8" xml:id="chapter-9fn8"

                        Glennon’s appeals, Gale Allen, the Chief of the CIA’s Classification Review
                        Division, explained “the Agency rationale” for its clearance actions. Allen
                        rejected Glennon’s assumption that “references from open literature”
                        constituted “authorized executive disclosure.” For the Agency to accept
                        otherwise would, “in the face of the First Amendment entitlement of most
                        Americans . . . and the weakness of our statutes with respect to the
                        protection of official secrets, place us in an untenable position.” Vital
                        secrets would then be “vulnerable to the Ellsbergs and Agees of this world
                        who, having purloined official classified material and had it published,
                        could then point to the fact of publication as a basis for requiring the
                        Agency to make official confirmation.” The Agency did not consider its own
                        pre-publication review of “semi-official memoir” manuscripts or legislative
                        disclosures (like the Church Committee’s final report) precedents for
                        authorized executive disclosure. Likewise, it insisted that the release of
                        CIA equities by “another component of the Executive Branch does not
                        constitute authorized executive disclosure by this Agency unless competent
                        authority of this Agency . . . has concurred.” Allen continued by outlining
                        the “standard Agency practice . . . not to disclose CIA locations abroad”
                        and citing statutory authority to withhold information concerning “the fact
                        of or details concerning intelligence liaison relationships between CIA and
                        foreign intelligence and security services.” Agency reviewers, he insisted,
                        focused upon the “present day impact of disclosure”; no document’s
                        historical significance could provide “sufficient justification to ignore
                        the possible present day difficulties that could result from disclosure.”
                        Allen concluded that the CIA was “well-advised not to release official
                        information that makes clear to host country authorities that CIA has or had
                        a station in the country, or that CIA has or had an intelligence liaison
                        relationship with intelligence services of the host country.” “Our concern,”
                        Allen assured HO, “is not that disclosure of this sort is embarrassing but
                        that it has a definite impact on current or future diplomatic and
                        operational environments in which the CIA must carry out intelligence
                            activities.”<note place="foot" n="16" xml:id="chapter-9fn16">Allen to

                        Allen’s position. On February 6, 1980, Trask tried to convince him that
                        documents selected for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> merited special
                        consideration for release. He argued that “the legal role of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in executive disclosure of
                        material containing CIA equities is of key importance” and that <hi

                        “subject to the needs of national security, to publish the material adjudged
                        important regardless of whether it has been previously disclosed.” CIA
                        insistence on “prior authorized executive disclosure” of material to be
                        cleared for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> made a mockery of the fundamental
                        purpose of the series and, Trask alleged, lacked legal standing. Moreover,
                        the CIA’s rigid policies ignored the balancing test provided by E.O. 12065
                        (identifiable damage to U.S. foreign policy vs. public’s right to
                        information), especially in cases when the Department of State believed that
                        a historical CIA presence or liaison relationship was no longer sensitive.
                        Trask urged the CIA to recognize that “omit[ting] significant categories of
                        foreign relations material” from the series “would compromise its
                        authoritative character,” “weaken the credibility of the series,” and,
                        consequently, damage the U.S. Government’s best tool for “revealing publicly
                        the record of its foreign policy in its full context.”<note place="foot"

                        came in the midst of the 1980 re-review, was scathing. Thomas White, the
                        Chief of the Information Services Staff (which oversaw the Classification
                        Review Group), informed Trask in July 1980 that “all final decisions with
                        respect to the declassification or the continued classification of”
                        intelligence-related information “must be made by officials of this Agency.
                        . . . The intelligence business,” he explained, “is unique and such
                        decisions can only be made, if we are to avoid damage to national security,
                        by persons fully knowledgeable of all relevant facts in any given instance.”
                        Far from downplaying <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s significance, White
                        explained that “the mandated role of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> and its
                        importance as the official history of United States foreign policy . . .
                        causes us particular concern since anything appearing in the <hi

                            characterization of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> as “the maximum form of
                            executive disclosure” in August 1979. At a meeting with HO historians,
                            an Information Review Officer for the Directorate of Operations
                            explained that “the Agency is very careful about each clause, sentence,
                            or document that is cleared for publication. The CIA knew that the
                            Soviets would scrutinize each new <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume, as
                            would the British and the French. He emphasized that there was no going
                            back once publication had occurred, so CIA reviewers must be cautious
                            beforehand.” See memorandum of conversation among Trask, Slany,

                        led the Agency to “be extremely careful that information regarding [the] CIA
                        appearing therein not be such as to damage the national security of the
                        United States.” Although Trask’s presumption that most “information may
                        become desensitized with the passage of time . . . may often be valid, it
                        [was] much less so in the case of information concerning intelligence
                        agencies and their activities.” Protecting historical sources was crucial
                        because it reassured current and future sources that their assistance to the
                        U.S. Government would “not redound against them or their families.” White
                        also reiterated the CIA’s rejection of prior unauthorized disclosure as a
                        rationale for releasing classified information. “To do so would,” he
                        alleged, “be to recognize the validity of everything that has been published
                        regarding the intelligence process over the years whether right or wrong,
                        sensitive or not, and we simply cannot take this position.” In his
                        conclusion, White staked the Agency’s claim “to protect a vast area [of
                        intelligence sources and methods] that is vital to our objectives and
                        without which we would be rendered useless.”<note place="foot" n="19"

                        Near the end of April, the Department’s declassification staff suggested to
                        Trask that a “30-year publication line is more sensible than the 20-year
                        line.” Trask responded that “delaying the series” was “overkill of the first

                        resulted from the traditional practice of avoiding discussions with foreign

                        he warned, “drawing distinctions between foreign countries in terms of their

                        chain of command. Unfortunately for Trask, his superiors had more immediate
                        concerns. On April 25, 1980, the White House acknowledged the failure of a
                        U.S. military operation to rescue American hostages in Tehran. Secretary of
                        State Cyrus Vance, who opposed the operation, resigned on April 28. Hodding
                        Carter followed Vance out of the Department by “phasing out” before
                        resigning in June. Amidst this chaos, Carter’s deputy William Dyess
                        “lack[ed] authority to do much” and “worrie[d] about missteps that might
                        affect his future.” Trask faced a leadership vacuum in PA that “worked
                        against anyone making decisions of any great moment.”<note place="foot"

                    <p>The conduct of the re-review confirmed HO’s anxieties. On May 7, Office staff
                        met with CDC reviewers to discuss the general economic and political affairs
                        compilation for 1952–1954. The meeting showed that the CDC’s re-review
                        “would be painstaking, raising the possibility of numerous objections to
                        previously cleared material” and that the new reviewers “clearly gave
                        priority to the need for withholding sensitive materials over the goal of
                        expediting the release of the diplomatic record.” After meeting their CDC
                        colleagues, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilers urged “HO management and
                        staff to take appropriate steps to contain possible damage” to the

                        <anchor xml:id="b_415"/>At a June 5 meeting of the Department’s committee
                        overseeing implementation of Carter’s executive order, Trask made his case
                        against the re-review. Dyess, newly installed as Acting Assistant Secretary
                        of State for Public Affairs, reminded his colleagues that their decisions
                        “went well beyond publication of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to the whole
                        question of sincerity about openness in government.” Other bureaus, however,
                        argued that Cold War concerns should outweigh the impulse for openness.
                        Robert Miller, the Director of Management Operations who filled in for the
                        absent Under Secretary Read, predicted that releasing “post-World War II
                        records would lead to many more [foreign policy] difficulties than had the
                        publication of earlier records . . . because there is continuity between the
                        early postwar years and the institutions that developed the[n] and the
                        present.” David Baehler countered that the Department had “yet to hear a
                        peep of protests from foreign governments reflecting foreign policy
                        difficulties” even though it had “been publishing postwar documents for
                        fifteen years now.”<note place="foot" n="39" xml:id="chapter-9fn39"
                            >Baehler’s statement was misleading. Although <hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi> did not cause significant “foreign policy difficulties,”
                            volumes did, on occasion, irritate foreign governments. See <ref

                                >8</ref>.</note> Miller remained unconvinced. He feared that “the
                        act of publication can be construed abroad as a political statement on the
                        part of the US government.” With assurances from the Government Printing
                        Office that re-reviewed manuscripts could be “fast-tracked” for early
                        publication, the Bureau of Management (M) and CDC dismissed HO’s warnings of
                        significant delays in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. Despite Trask’s criticism
                        of the decisionmaking process that led to the re-review, his warnings of
                        looming “image problems” with the academic community, and his projection of
                        delays and cost overruns, the Department bureaucracy rejected HO’s arguments
                        and proceeded with the re-review.<note place="foot" n="40"

                        Staff, Trask argued that, “if the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>

                        Given the fundamental importance of information in the function of a
                        democratic society, no policy issue can be of comparable importance.”<note

                            had already fallen behind schedule. In a report to Newsom, Dyess pointed
                            out that only two of the 18 compilations being re-reviewed (two others
                            relating to Iran had been deferred indefinitely) had “run the full
                            course preparatory to publication.” While HO had received information
                            about four other manuscripts, it still had no response from CDC
                            concerning two-thirds of the re-review workload that was supposed to
                            have been completed entirely by November 1. On November 18, the CDC
                            presented only a preliminary and incomplete assessment rather than a
                            full review of the 20 volumes in question. Baehler judged the report
                                “<hi rend="italic">not</hi> a reliable indication of what will be
                            deleted upon arrival of formal judgments.” At the conclusion of an
                            8-month re-review process, CDC was no closer to providing HO staff with
                            clarity about the criteria employed to determine excisions. See Dyess to

                        the re-review for specific volumes, representatives of the CDC exhibited
                        skepticism about the value of the series and government transparency. One
                        CDC reviewer displayed “a surprising degree of carelessness and disregard
                        for the provisions of Executive Order 12065 and related Department of State
                        regulations” when he met with HO staff members on September 5. To <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians, the CDC treated <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> “as though it were a current public affairs pamphlet intended
                        to explain policies or create a favorable image abroad, rather than as the
                        official and objective record of United States foreign policy.”<note

                            (formerly a political officer at the U.S. Embassy in London and special
                            assistant to Read) staked out the extreme anti-openness position later
                            in September. He asserted that publishing documents in <hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi> gave “them a stature they would not possess if released
                            elsewhere.” He told the historians that “the KGB is [<hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi>’s] best customer and that we must accordingly be
                            extremely careful in publishing records in” the series. In Baehler’s
                            eyes, Galloway “displayed extreme condescension” in his “conviction that
                            only . . . front-line officers could possibly be aware of all of the
                            foreign policy implications publication might have.” Moreover, “Galloway
                            completely ignored the basic purpose of the series . . . to inform the
                            American people of their government’s foreign policy. His exclusive
                            concern was with the effect that publication would have on foreign
                            governments or on US relations with those governments . . . never
                            mentioning the need to maintain the trust and confidence of the American
                            people as an element of [the] national interest.” To Galloway (and
                            others who shared his views), <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> was “a tool to
                            be used for political purposes in . . . reinforcing favorable attitudes
                            of the US among US allies.” Baehler characterized Galloway as more
                            hostile to transparency than most in CDC, but reflective of CIA views.

                        be delayed “on the grounds that the Yugoslavia materials might endanger the

                        October 1980. Even before Trask’s Dissent Channel appeal, HO considered the
                        European Security volume for 1951 to be an ideal test case for challenging
                        the results of the re-review within normal bureaucratic channels. On May 30,
                        David Baehler argued that the deletions demanded by EUR and CDC “get us down
                        to basics very quickly . . . are we trying to publish a historical record
                        describing as completely as possible such things as the considerations
                        involved in the entry of Greece and Turkey into NATO, or are we publishing
                        something akin to a White paper the contents of which are determined more by

                        on two basic questions: “what are our obligations to our allies and to
                        NATO?” and how should the “possible damage of release to national security .
                        . . be weighed against the right of the public to the information”? Newsom
                        pressed all three officials. The Under Secretary asked Trask about clearing
                        foreign government information and <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s role in the
                        overall declassification process. He queried Vest about the continued
                        sensitivities of NATO military planning and documents relating to Greece and
                        Turkey’s admission to NATO. Pickering intervened at several points to
                        clarify CDC views on declassification procedures and authorities.
                        Ultimately, Newsom upheld the continued secrecy of documents referencing
                        Yugoslavia and those relating to Greek and Turkish entrance into NATO. CDC
                        also secured a postponement of plans to release NATO military planning
                        documents pending further consultations with the NSC.<note place="foot"

                        “central to the Department’s adherence to the principle of open government,”
                        but accepted the CDC’s argument that the possible “negative impact upon our

                        accepted at face value the CDC’s optimistic projections for completing the

                        and reaffirmed the adequacy of the Department’s existing policies and

                        <anchor xml:id="b_227"/>With its new authority, CDC transformed the way the
                        Department cleared FGI for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. By consulting with
                        allied governments before unilaterally releasing U.S. documents containing
                        potentially sensitive FGI, CDC predicted that HO would be able “to publish
                        more rather than less.” Although this was occasionally the case, the
                        Department pursued these new consultations to maintain, not relax, secrecy.
                        While the new procedures would only apply to Great Britain, Canada,
                        Australia, and New Zealand at first, McManaway anticipated that the
                        Department could “extend the range of such consultations to include other
                        allied governments.”<note place="foot" n="68" xml:id="chapter-9fn68">Draft

                            Box 2, <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> 2.</note> The CIA lauded
                        “the excellence of the relationship and understanding” that it developed
                        with CDC. Several CDC reviewers visited the Agency soon after they took over
                        declassification coordination responsibilities to obtain guidance on CIA
                        policies regarding releasing “material already published in open literature”
                        and “how to process information showing CIA relationship[s] with foreign
                        liaison services.” After McManaway complained to the Agency in April 1981
                        that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> declassification discussions had taken
                        place outside the CDC channel, his Agency counterpart cited the
                        “incalculable help” that the CDC had provided in “protecting our equities”
                        since that office assumed the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> declassification
                        coordination function. The Agency counterpart asked his staff to “strengthen
                        Clay’s [McManaway’s] hand and prevent him from being blindsided in this
                        process.” The Agency’s discovery in June 1981 that HO unilaterally restored
                        material excised by a CIA review only heightened its relief at the CDC’s
                        expanded role in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> declassification. By July 1981,
                        the only re-reviewed compilations for which the CIA had not yet restored
                        clearances were “the Middle East volumes and Latin America (all 1952–54),
                        and they are hung up for other reasons as well.” By early 1982, the CIA
                        developed sufficient confidence in the CDC’s judgments to delegate much of
                        their authority to review documents intended for publication in proposed <hi

                        Francis McNamara agreed that HO needed to “reassess [its] goals.” With the
                        20-year line slipping away, the Department embarked on “compensatory
                        activities to mitigate the credibility gap and expand the policy oriented
                        research program.” While half of HO personnel focused on “sustaining the
                        publication of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> at its present level
                        and plan for a renewed burst of compiling in two or three years,” the other
                        half were redirected to policy studies to help “upgrade the Department’s
                        role in the making of overall national policy.” To “compensate to some
                        extent for the failure to attain the twenty-year line,” HO also revived the
                            <hi rend="italic">Current Documents</hi> series (compiled from
                        unclassified documents) that had been suspended in 1971.<note place="foot"

                            December 1957, Dulles extolled a compilation of 1950–1955 documents as
                            “go[ing] quite a ways toward meeting the needs of scholars” even if it
                            “d[id] not technically meet the conventional requirements” of <hi

                        Trask really couldn’t stay in the Historian’s Office.” As Deputy Assistant
                        Secretary of State for Public Affairs Francis McNamara recalled in a 1993
                        oral history interview, the entire re-review ordeal resulted from Ben Read’s
                        determination to prevent “documents that [he and his allies in EUR and CDC]
                        considered sensitive coming out in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series” without “open dissent” that could generate
                        “newspaper attention.” McNamara recalled Gammon (Trask’s contact in M as the
                        re-review commenced) confiding “that this is all just window dressing, the
                        under secretary doesn’t want these documents to come out.” By 1981, “Dyess
                        was really down on Trask; he wanted to get rid of him.” In the spring
                        McNamara gave Trask a “solomonic” efficiency report that satisfied Dyess and
                        enabled Trask to go “off happily” to a job at the Center for Military
                        History. McNamara’s experience with Trask in 1980 and 1981 led him to
                        observe, “I don’t see how you could have that job without getting in
                            trouble.”<note place="foot" n="81" xml:id="chapter-9fn81">Charles Stuart

                        including restricted access to highly-classified intelligence documents and
                        inconsistent declassification practices. In 1981 and 1982, HO reluctantly
                        proceeded with publication despite the volume’s obviously-incomplete account
                        of U.S. activities in Guatemala. In doing so, the volume’s compiler and many
                        of his colleagues took pains to acknowledge the volume’s lacunae in hopes of
                        immunizing themselves and the Department from accusations of fraud or
                        incompetence. Their efforts succeeded in the short term and the volume’s
                        release coincided with academic community initiatives to lobby for
                        accelerating the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series without sacrificing its

                        of State historians made crucial decisions regarding the Guatemala chapter
                        of the 1952–1954 American Republics volume. In discussions with the CIA
                        during the summer of 1979, a CIA declassification reviewer for the
                        Directorate of Operations explained that “CIA would have to resist
                        publication of anything more than the basic fact that the Agency
                        participated in the overthrow of the Arbenz regime,” but that “CIA would
                        defer to the State Department on the foreign relations aspect of the issue.
                        If the Department . . . determined that no foreign relations problem was
                        involved, such information could be published.” He also explained that, “on
                        questions of policy concerning covert activities, CIA was really only an
                        executive secretariat to the NSC in the later 1950s and 1960s” and that HO
                        should “approach the National Security Council on access to and
                        declassification of the sort of material [it] sought from the CIA.”<note

                        efforts to protect the integrity of the series. He wanted to wait for CIA
                        clearance decisions on a “supplemental package of editorial notes based on
                        CIA cables” and to appeal “NSC deletions of material which has appeared

                        a high-level policy decision prohibiting coverage of covert activities,” he
                        explained, “HO has an obligation, consonant with its original mandate, to
                        make the effort, and to account for its failure, if necessary. If HO permits
                        silence to substitute for substance, and gaps in the record for
                        accountability, the series’ reputation as a credible and objective official
                        documentary publication will not endure.” Although Kane acknowledged that HO
                        could not win every clearance battle, he insisted that giving up on the
                        American Republics volume would not only “seriously erode the credibility of
                        the series,” it would also “send a clear signal to the CIA that if it defers
                        a decision long enough HO will make it voluntarily.” He warned that moving
                        ahead would “radically change the nature of HO’s mission” and “impose a form
                        of self-censorship on the series.” Kane recommended that, if necessary, HO
                        “insert a meaningful disclaimer . . . to account for the lack of coverage”
                        if it failed to secure release of essential information. He also urged HO
                        management to “initiate the appropriate process at higher levels in the
                        Department to redefine the official rationale of the <hi rend="italic"

                        many HO historians endorsed Kane’s recommendations in March and April, Trask
                        decided to proceed with publication irrespective of the CIA’s eventual
                        clearance decisions at the end of April 1981. Trask’s decision reflected his
                        acceptance of post-re-review realities. Senior Department officials had
                        concluded that the traditional standard of transparency for potentially
                        controversial U.S. policies and actions was imprudent. The CIA had shown
                        little enthusiasm for releasing even seemingly innocuous materials about its
                        role in decisionmaking or its presence overseas, to say nothing of
                        documentation of major covert operations. In this context, Trask concluded
                        that obtaining clearances for publishing the full record of U.S. policy in
                        Guatemala during the 1952–1954 period would be impossible and that HO should
                        save whatever bureaucratic leverage it still possessed for less quixotic
                        efforts. To the HO staff and the HAC, he rationalized that “the [uncleared]
                        information is not deemed of sufficient import to merit delay either in the
                        publication of the volume or of the particular compilation within the volume
                        in which the materials in question appear.”<note place="foot" n="92"

                            obtaining clearance of the compilation on Guatemala in this volume, . .
                            . that we remove the compilation (or portions of it) for future

                            He was particularly interested in creating a “special <hi rend="italic"

                        strategies to mitigate the damage. In the spring of 1983, HO managers
                        settled on language for an expanded introduction to the volume that included
                        a disclaimer acknowledging: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>the editors did not and could not, under current government

                                document systematically all aspects of the widening web of official
                                relationships which the United States Government established and
                                maintained in the Western Hemisphere. A more comprehensive
                                accounting of these expanding relationships, particularly in the
                                military and intelligence dimensions, requires readers and
                                researchers to consult official publications and papers of other

                        qualified the comprehensiveness of the volume with “necessary security

                        Central Intelligence Agency, it did alert careful readers that the volume

                            concerned about the Guatemala chapter than his staff. He asked, “Why
                            should Guatemala be so highlighted and why should we stumble about on
                            the whereabouts of military and intelligence activities in the volume”
                            as HO revised the volume summary that would be distributed with review
                            copies. He urged his colleagues to “try to be positive in our approach,
                            helpful to writers of articles and reviewers, and upbeat about our
                            methodology” in the final draft. Slany to Petersen, Glennon, Carol

                        that, “after a six year delay, the State Department . . . published the

                        leftist Government in Guatemala in 1954. But,” the lead noted, “all material
                        on the covert role of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense
                        Department was omitted” from the volume. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
                        explained that the American Republics volume “covered the first case in
                        which covert activity played a crucial role in American relations with
                        another Government, but the official American documentation of those
                        relations cannot be published in full.” The article quoted Glennon lamenting
                        that “we were not successful in declassifying everything we wanted.” Glennon
                        explained that “we try to make it as comprehensive as we can” and that,

                            lofty standards maintained by the Office of the Historian . . . over the
                            years, and reflects its dedication to the arduous but important process

                            professor at the University of Exeter, concluded that although “the
                            section on Guatemala underlines the difficulty of dealing with still
                            politically sensitive subjects and shows how it is not practicable for
                            the series to become ‘the comprehensive record’ of major policy

                        <anchor xml:id="b_939"/>In 1982, President Ronald Reagan replaced Carter’s
                        E.O. 12065 with a new directive on classifying and declassifying national
                        security information. Executive Order 12356 eliminated the previous order’s
                        balancing test and its timetables for systematic review. The driving force
                        for this shift came from within the bureaucracies of executive branch
                        agencies. Clayton McManaway prepared the Department of State’s
                        recommendations to “eliminate automatic declassification,” “further protect
                        foreign government information,” “eliminate systematic review in present
                        form,” and extend classification extension authority to more officials. He
                        also advised phasing out “complicating” provisions such as “the exhortations
                        to give declassification equal weight with classification,” “encourag[ing]
                        personnel to challenge classification,” and “the ‘balancing act’ concept
                        theoretically enabling release of correctly classified information in favor
                        of a vague public interest.” Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs
                        William Dyess conditioned his concurrence with McManaway’s proposals upon
                        CDC assurances that it would prepare “a joint schedule” to maintain the
                        “pace [for] special clearances of documents” for <hi rend="italic"

                            Ambassador John Burke explained that “the recent executive order was
                            more stringent than its predecessors . . . , but . . . it had been
                            drafted not by the White House but by the Information Security Oversight
                            Office (ISOO)” and “reflected the experience of many officials from
                            different agencies.” Burke echoed this characterization in a 1989 oral
                            history interview, when he claimed that “certain deficiencies in the
                            Carter Order . . . had to be corrected” and that “the stricter
                            provisions were actually all proposed by bureaucrats and not by the
                            White House.” See minutes of 1985 HAC meeting, p. 17, Department of

                        of the CDC and the 1980 re-review controversy, inspired concern among
                        transparency advocates that “excessive secrecy” was taking hold in the U.S.
                        Government. In a September 1983 <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>
                        article, historians lamented that it was “‘virtually impossible’ to write
                        American diplomatic history after 1950.” HAC member Anna Nelson elaborated
                        that the government’s restrictions made it difficult for historians and
                        international relations scholars to avoid “writ[ing] inadequately and in a
                        distorted fashion. . . . We are depriving our next generation of

                        concerns in its annual report to the Department of State. On December 21,
                        1983, Committee Chair Ernest May informed Secretary of State George Shultz
                        that “the history of American foreign policy after World War II is poorly
                        understood” because “the sources necessary for writing fair and
                        comprehensive histories” were being “withheld from serious scholars.” “More
                        and more of the history,” he lamented, “consists merely of remembered
                        headlines, for scholars cannot see the documents which would enable them to
                        correct the record.” May assured Shultz that “our collective national
                        security interests will be served” if the Department embarked upon “modest
                        steps to improve the conditions for scholarly research.” Specifically, May
                        and the HAC urged Shultz to open historical records belonging to the
                        Department for research at a 25-year line, “lead an effort to make such a
                        policy government-wide,” and order HO to accelerate the production of <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes “reflective of the whole record, with
                        any necessary omissions specifically identified so that the international
                        scholarly community can retain confidence in the integrity of the series.”
                        By reminding Shultz that “intelligent public and congressional understanding
                        of history is a precondition for sound and effective national policies,” May
                        hoped to convince Shultz that strengthening the Department’s existing <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>-centered transparency regime would serve the
                        interests of both the U.S. Government and the academic community.<note

                            potential interviewees. The Agency urged that former CIA officials “give

                        Slany’s August report to Congress, which diagnosed <hi rend="italic"

                        October, that provided a prescription for accelerating the series. Both the
                        report and the staff study rejected a 25-year line and described a 30-year
                        standard as difficult to meet. As Slany’s report to Congress explained, “a
                        30-year line is a reasonable and achievable goal for the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> series, but a wide range of conceptual and
                        procedural modifications are required if such a goal is to be achieved.” He
                        blamed “a wide range of compiling, clearance, and publishing problems” for
                        the existing delay in the series, but elaborated that “few of the issues are
                        really new.”<note place="foot" n="108" xml:id="chapter-9fn108">Slany,

                        <anchor xml:id="b_207"/>In his report to Congress, Slany cited enduring
                        challenges to timeliness and comprehensiveness that had confronted the
                        series since the 1950s. He described how “uncertainty over the definition
                        [of comprehensiveness] prevents the making of sound and consistent decisions
                        on all phases of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program.”
                        Slany explained how the 1925 Kellogg Order established a “constant framework
                        for preparation of” <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, but “actual compiling
                        practices and the changing expectations of users have increasingly come into
                        conflict with the charter’s principles.” He elaborated that HO’s efforts to
                        improve the quality of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> during the 1970s by
                        “systematically us[ing] the records of other agencies,” shift[ing] the focus
                        from “traditional diplomatic exchanges” to the policymaking process, and
                        “extend[ing] the series into the most sensitive and controversial episodes
                        of American intelligence activities and political action in foreign
                        countries” resulted in a “slowdown in the publication of the series.” Slany
                        also cited mounting printing problems to illustrate the impossibility of
                        simultaneously accelerating the series and maintaining its current level of
                        coverage. Citing “sixty years of experience by the Office of the Historian,”
                        Slany recognized “the futility of all efforts to bring [<hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi>] closer to currency unless and until careful, even severe,
                        restraint can be exercised on the size of the series.” To explain the
                        Department’s skepticism about the feasibility of meeting a 25-year
                        publication line, Slany cited the “prodigious effort in compiling, editing,
                        declassification, and publication never before attempted or envisaged” that
                        would be required. Slany endorsed a 30-year target that would align <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> with the Department’s systematic review
                        commitments, “provide a more realistic interval to declassify and
                        desensitize most secrets,” and accord with British practice.<note

                        report with several cautionary notes. The first involved the “intense”
                        restraint that would be required of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians
                        to avoid aggravating perennial access, declassification, printing, and scope
                        problems. Such restraint clashed with “demands from within the government
                        and the public for expanded volumes. The prospective size and scope of the
                        series must have full support from within government and from academic and
                        scholarly users.” Secondly, Slany insisted that “criteria of completeness
                        and comprehensiveness of the official foreign affairs record which have been
                        debated over recent years must be defined. The current definition of
                        comprehensiveness has not satisfied academic users.” He cautioned that,
                        “without an agreement on the scope of” <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, “any
                        program for publication will, however expensive, be hopelessly burdened with
                        controversy.” Finally, Slany warned that “drawing closer to currency will
                        necessarily result in a larger proportion of documents denied
                        declassification on national security grounds or because of current
                        sensitivity,” which would frustrate the general preference among <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s consumers for “a more comprehensive series,
                        even if published later, than for more selective volumes.”<note place="foot"

                            supplementary volumes. In their reports to Slany, HO historians grappled
                            with the trade-offs required between timeliness and comprehensiveness as
                            they defined “low,” “middle,” and “high” options for every facet of <hi

                            achieve them. When CDC received initial drafts, SR chief Hamilton
                            explained that “[the studies] show the head of steam which Slany
                            generated within his own boiler room and the time which HO has devoted
                            to an essentially non-productive activity.” He advised a colleague that
                            “they may well be worth your skimming for more illumination on the state
                            of thinking and the character of bureaucratic activity in HO.” Sampson

                        for Shultz’s approval on October 10, 1984, provided detailed recommendations
                        for action from HO, the CDC, the Foreign Affairs Information Management
                        Center (FAIM), and the Publishing Services Division (FAIM/PS) to accelerate
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> production to sustain a 30-year line. These
                        recommendations reinforced the longstanding significance of <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> by maintaining the close linkage between
                        clearance of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> compilations and the
                        broader systematic review undertaken by the Department for records being
                        sent to the National Archives. For HO, the study affirmed Slany’s
                        inclination to “redefine the scope and size of” <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        to include “only the most important documents and policies and events in
                        American foreign policy,” to “introduce microform supplements . . . to
                        assure the publication of a wide range and variety of official records”
                        notwithstanding the constraints on the printed volumes, to “adhere strictly
                        . . . to size limitations for the series,” and to “limit the number of
                        documents of foreign origin . . . to facilitate declassification.” For the
                        CDC, the study recommended increased resources and enhanced coordination
                        with HO. The study also proposed technological modernization and reformed
                        procedures to streamline the Department’s records management and
                        declassification machinery. Finally, the study advocated forging an
                        executive branch consensus “that the series <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations of the United States</hi> is the preferred and authoritative
                        vehicle for public disclosure of the official foreign affairs record” and
                        called for a new Presidential Directive to promote interagency cooperation.

                        on November 12, 1985, translated the transparency and accountability values
                        ascribed to <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> since the 19th century to conform to
                        the altered national security context of the 1980s. Reagan ordered the
                        Department of State to take the lead in ensuring that <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> meet the 30-year line by 1990, affirming “that orderly and
                        timely” publication of the series, which provided “the proper vehicle for
                        systematic official disclosure of the major documentation regarding American
                        foreign policy in its proper historical context,” was “extremely important.”
                        The Directive qualified its endorsement that “the historic record when
                        published should be as complete as possible” with explicit reference to
                        “other directives on the release and publication of official information”
                        (E.O. 12356) in addition to “the needs of national security and the
                        expectation of confidentiality in the diplomatic process.” Reagan instructed
                        other agencies to cooperate with the Department of State by providing access
                        to “properly cleared” HO historians and “according the necessary priority”
                        to reviewing selected documents for declassification. Reagan also empowered
                        the Secretary of State to convene interagency meetings to “review and
                        improve cooperative procedures and plans to meet [the] 30-year publication
                        timeframe.” Finally, Reagan also required the Department of State to submit
                        annual status reports on progress toward achieving the 30-year publication

                            />At the 1985 HAC annual meeting, Slany predicted that the as-yet
                            unsigned directive would “probably be the most important thing that has
                            happened to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in ten
                            years. It will produce a more effective clearance process; it will
                            enable the Department to take the lead in publishing the foreign affairs
                            record; and it will provide PA/HO with improved procedures and the
                            leverage to ensure that the process moved forward.” HAC members
                            expressed skepticism, with Deborah Larson explaining that “the general
                            perception in the presidential libraries was that President Reagan was
                            not eager to release information. She could not see how the directive
                            would have a beneficial impact if the president’s attitude was well
                            known.” Later, Warren Kuehl confessed that “he could not understand how
                            the Presidential Directive would accelerate the [clearance] process.”

                        re-review, and the acceleration initiative of the mid-1980s transformed <hi

                        records at Presidential Libraries in the mid-1970s, they encountered
                        frustrating obstacles when they tried to declassify and publish the
                        resulting compilations in the early 1980s. The Department of State’s
                        implementation of President Carter’s executive order on classification and
                        declassification strengthened opponents of transparency and caused
                        unintended damage to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in
                        1980. Bruised by the re-review battle within the Department, HO retreated
                        from confrontation over the Guatemala volume in 1981–1982 and embraced a
                        compromise-laden acceleration plan in 1984 and 1985. The erosion of

                        publication lag in the mid-1980s but left key issues unresolved. Between
                        1986 and 1989, HO published 26 volumes at an average publication line of 31
                        years. HO still faced obstacles to accessing highly-classified materials
                        controlled by other agencies. Foreign governments continued to influence
                        U.S. decisionmaking about the release of historical secrets. Most
                        significantly, U.S. Government officials and the academic community still
                        held discordant views about the scope of the series, which reflected
                        incompatible positions about the nature of the U.S. Government transparency
                        regime. The accelerated <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series embodied a
                        compromise that resulted in translucency, rather than transparency. By the
                        mid-1980s, HO found itself attempting to navigate a very narrow space
                        between public expectations for openness and official demands for security.
                        Could the Office produce volumes that the U.S. Government would be willing
                        to release as an official publication, while also meeting public
                        expectations for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s integrity? As the
                        Department’s relationship with the HAC deteriorated in the late 1980s, HO
                        struggled to salvage a worsening <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> problem.</p>

                        in 1990 after HAC Chair Warren Cohen resigned in protest when the

                        access to classified documents. The Iran volume and Cohen’s resignation
                        exposed the Department’s 1980s retreat from transparency just as the Cold

                        strategy to meet the “1960 by 1990” objective. HO’s task was easiest since
                        only 12 volumes in the 1958–1960 awaited compilation; these volumes, Slany
                        promised, would be complete by the end of 1988. The declassification
                        workload was more substantial. CDC had to review 28 volumes between 1986 and
                        1990. Other agencies had to handle 34. Since the NSC waited until other
                        agencies completed their reviews before beginning its own, it faced the
                        largest clearance burden: 44 volumes in only 4 years. Even if all volumes
                        were cleared, the Department and GPO had to push 50 through the printing
                        process. Complicating this already formidable task, Slany sought to mitigate
                        the size limitations imposed on printed volumes by producing 11 microfiche
                        supplements that also required declassification. HO also wanted to bring a
                        highly-visible subset of the series to a 21-year line by completing the <hi

                        budgetary caps, HO tightened page limits for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        manuscripts. To lower the cost of producing the series, the Department and
                        GPO contracted with a commercial printing firm to perform some <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> editing and publishing tasks. These savings came
                        with a “tradeoff between volume size and cost. Each additional page above
                        800 . . . has a dollar cost associated with it.” Imposing the new page limit
                        on already-compiled volumes forced HO to “decompile” cleared manuscripts “to
                        ensure that only the most important documents were included.” To assuage
                        fears that these cost constraints would decimate <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi>, HO emphasized the potential of relatively inexpensive microfiche
                        supplements to make up for the shortfall. As HO’s budget grew more strained
                        in 1987, Slany proposed that microfiche bear more of the aggregate
                        publishing burden. Although HAC members recognized the necessity of cutting
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> production costs, they were anxious about
                        the implications of narrowing space constraints and HO’s increasing reliance
                        on microfiche supplements to stay within its budget. They worried that both
                        the comprehensiveness and the utility of the series was jeopardized by these
                            “solutions.”<note place="foot" n="4" xml:id="chapter-10fn4">Slany to

                                rend="italic">FRUS</hi> during the era of translucency strained
                            relations within HO. In a spring 1988 complaint to the Department’s
                            Inspector General, Deputy Historian Neal Petersen alleged that
                            mismanagement, rather than budgetary constraints, led to the
                            “decompilation” requirement. As Petersen explained, “the Historian’s
                            Office is now telling the public that due to demands of PA and the
                            Department the series must be cut and transferred in substantial part to
                            a microfiche format. PA/HO contends that the pinch is such that volumes
                            already compiled, edited, and declassified must be slashed on a crash
                            basis. Completed work is being discarded on a massive basis. This is not
                            to deny the seriousness of the Department’s budget crisis or the need
                            for tight controls on all spending. The fact is, however, bad management
                            and invalid priorities within PA/HO pose a greater threat to the series
                            than external restrictions.” Regarding decompilation, Petersen described
                            how, “in order to reduce the size of volumes over-compiled at his
                            [Slany’s] direction, The Historian instructed the <hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi> staff to remove large numbers of already-edited and
                            cleared documents. The meticulous work of many years was wasted. . . .
                            The cutting is being done on short notice with severe damage to
                            substance. . . . This enormously wasteful process is The Historian’s
                            answer to a problem he himself created by mismanaging the planning and
                            compilation of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, first as Editor, then as

                        initiative forced transparency skeptics to offer rhetorical support to the

                        William Casey responded to a coalition of the AHA, the OAH, and the Society
                        of American Archivists demanding “a commitment to maximum possible openness”
                        with assurances that he too “admir[ed] the Department of State’s
                        distinguished series” and “recognize[d] its important role in informing the
                        American people about their government’s foreign policy.” Although Casey
                        rejected their principle “when in doubt, declassify,” he promised that the
                        CIA balanced “the need to protect our national security interests” with “the

                        provided sufficient protection for foreign government equities. The CDC also

                        production between 1986 and 1990, relations between the Department and the
                        HAC grew increasingly adversarial. The late 1980s clash between the HAC and
                        the CDC illustrated the more general polarization between champions of
                        transparency and guardians of security in American society as the
                        Iran-Contra scandal exacerbated public skepticism of the integrity of the
                        U.S. Government. The HAC’s feud with the CDC reflected fundamental
                        disagreements about authority, responsibility, and accountability for the
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> process. Because the HAC claimed authority
                        to ascertain whether <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> provided an objective and
                        comprehensive account of U.S. foreign policy, Committee members demanded
                        access to documents withheld in whole or in part from the series. The HAC
                        considered the Department as a whole responsible for producing <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> and held the entire Department accountable for
                        maintaining its reliability and utility. The CDC bitterly opposed HAC
                        attempts to insert itself into the declassification process. CDC officials
                        considered the HAC mandate limited to affairs under the jurisdiction of the
                        Bureau of Public Affairs. Despite PA and HO efforts to broker a compromise
                        between insistent academics and resentful declassifiers, relations between
                        the HAC and the Department worsened. As HO and PA lobbied Under Secretary
                        Spiers to forge a compromise, officials from CDC and Management Operations
                        (M/MO; later Management Policy, M/MP, and Financial and Management Policy,
                        M/FMP) campaigned to neutralize the HAC. A “civil war within the Department”
                        erupted over whether to placate or terminate the Committee.<note

                        meeting, Slany worried that CDC intransigence over the Committee’s access to
                        classified documents would encourage the HAC to complain about excessive
                        secrecy and make it impossible to “assure the credibility of the
                        Department’s publication.”<note place="foot" n="18" xml:id="chapter-10fn18"

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1003"/>At the HAC meeting in November, the CDC failed to
                        placate the HAC. With the acceleration schedule projecting output of “more
                        than 50 volumes . . . in the next four years.” Slany emphasized the need for
                        pre-publication review to provide early warning if “volumes were flawed in
                        some serious way.” The Committee shared Slany’s objective, but insisted that
                        a meaningful assessment of the series had to investigate “deletions made
                        during the declassification process to determine the accuracy of the
                        remaining record to be published.”<note place="foot" n="19"

                            1986.</note> In the afternoon session, a team of CDC officers and
                        declassifiers briefed the committee on CDC operations and its clearance
                        decisions for four <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes. Instead of
                        satisfying the HAC, the briefing fueled its demands, both to examine excised
                        documents and to improve editorial practices for alerting readers to deleted
                        material. After “an impassioned exchange” with members of the HAC, CDC
                        reviewer William Galloway fumed that “historians would never be satisfied
                        with the government’s actions or what could be revealed about them” and
                        insisted that “the government must have the last word.” Galloway’s
                        adversarial tone prompted Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public
                        Affairs George High to intervene and explain that, “in the post-Vietnam
                        era[,] the public was not wholly trustful of the government and that it
                        behooved those in public service to be as forthcoming as possible in terms
                        of openness about their work.”<note place="foot" n="20"

                        submitted to HO in February 1987, warned that “we cannot report to our

                        1986 HAC report sparked conflict within the Department. The struggle pitted
                        HO and PA against the CDC and officials in M and escalated from a debate
                        over the HAC’s access to classified information to threaten the HAC with
                        termination by the fall of 1987. At the end of March, Under Secretary of
                        State for Management Ronald Spiers affirmed to Perkins that the HAC’s views
                        were “a key element” in ensuring that the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>

                        the Spiers–Perkins meeting throughout the spring. Dwight Ambach attributed
                        HAC criticism to “their perceived need to demonstrate . . . that they are
                        vigorously pursuing academic community interests [and] . . . a lack of
                        realism.” “The most useful role the Committee could play,” he insisted,
                        “would be to advise HO on the composition of future <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes and selection of topics, leaving details of
                        compilation and clearance to historians and declassifiers.”<note

                        Department’s acceleration plan if it could assess the documents removed from
                        volumes by HO or withheld by CDC.<note place="foot" n="26"

                    <p>Although Spiers’s meeting with Perkins seemed to enable compromise between
                        the HAC and the Department, officials in M and CDC co-opted the follow-up
                        process. The HAC’s critics shifted the intra-Departmental debate away from
                        determining the appropriate level of access for the Committee and toward
                        determining whether to continue the HAC’s existence. After meeting with
                        Perkins, Spiers decided to implement, on a trial basis, PA’s recommendation
                        to give the HAC access to still-classified materials denied clearance for
                        publication in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> and solicit HAC comments on
                        “proposed written declassification guidelines.” At the same time, however,
                        he called upon PA, CDC, and the Department’s legal staff to work with M/MO
                        (Management Operations) to “review . . . the activities and membership of
                        the [HAC] to ensure that” the HAC was “fulfilling its purpose of providing
                        advice, ideas, or recommendations to the Department” and determine whether
                        its “membership [was] balanced in terms of the points of view represented
                        and the functions to be performed.” Spiers supported compromise, but enabled
                        the HAC’s critics in the Department to undermine the Committee’s
                            legitimacy.<note place="foot" n="28" xml:id="chapter-10fn28">MO

                        intensifying Department management over its operations. MO accepted CDC
                        contentions that the HAC “functioned to a considerable degree as a special
                        interest pressure group” lobbying for “professional academic interests . . .
                        in disclosure matters [that] are in conflict with government security
                        concerns.” This advocacy, MO warned, “pose[d] unacceptable potential risks
                        to national security and the conduct of foreign relations.” Moreover, MO
                        suspected that the HAC “exacerbated . . . the normal healthy differences
                        between A/CDC and PA/HO.” While it concluded that terminating the HAC would
                        be “premature at this time,” MO recommended against “having an advisory

                    <p>The impasse over the HAC within the Department alarmed Committee members.
                        When the unresolved internal debate forced the Department to postpone the
                        Committee’s 1987 meeting, Perkins warned Slany that “several of your
                        Indians” on the Committee “are restive and are tempted to stray off the
                        reservation” by undertaking a mass resignation to publicize their concerns
                        about the series’s integrity. The threat of a public backlash led the
                        Department to defer decisions about the HAC’s future until after its next
                        meeting, rescheduled for January 1988.<note place="foot" n="34"

                        tensions. Deputy Assistant Secretary High outlined the Department’s
                        continuing efforts to respond to the HAC’s concerns and steered discussion
                        toward editorial matters that would ease CDC anxieties. HAC members
                        expressed willingness to accept any method for declassifying <hi

                        verify the accuracy and comprehensiveness” of volumes. CDC reviewers again
                        offered detailed, frank, oral briefings about their reviews of specific
                        volumes. This time, Committee members “applauded” the declassifiers’
                        “forthcoming briefings.” After praising a “most useful and informative”
                        dialogue with a CDC reviewer, Committee member Robert Dallek urged the CDC
                        to recognize the “extraordinary cynicism in the American public about U.S.
                        foreign policy” and “the need for [public] consensus and support.”<note

                        the CDC.” The report nevertheless requested that “this method of mutual
                        education and reassurance . . . be further developed” to assure that the

                        attempting to forge an independent “new dialogue” with HAC Chair Perkins.
                        Amidst deadlock within the Department, Slany briefed Assistant Secretary of
                        State for Public Affairs Charles Redman that “CDC has persuaded M/MO that
                        [the HAC] has become obtrusive and needs to be reined in and restructured.”
                        If this judgment held, he warned, Committee members would conclude that
                        their “usefulness is near an end.” He predicted that the HAC would “probably
                        resign—with some dudgeon” if the deadlock continued.<note place="foot"

                        its complaints about the CDC, to Congress. On May 20, Page Putnam Miller,
                        the Director of the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of
                        History (an advocacy and lobbying group created by professional historical
                        associations in the early 1980s), wrote to Senate Intergovernmental Affairs
                        Committee Chair John Glenn (D–OH). She solicited congressional assistance to
                        ensure that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> “adhere to the thirty year time line
                        established by President Reagan and that these volumes present as complete
                        and open a record as possible.” Miller alleged that weak oversight allowed
                        the CDC to “function [in] an extremely slow and cautious manner.” She
                        confided that HAC members, “frustrated that they are being used to rubber
                        stamp and not to advise, are considering resigning en masse” and suggested
                        that “some indication of congressional concern about this problem could be
                        most helpful.” Arguing that “scholars who write contemporary history are a
                        valuable national resource,” Miller concluded that “it is in the best
                        interest of the country to have its contemporary history written on the
                        basis of as much open, nonprivileged information as possible.”<note

                        convinced Under Secretary Spiers to veto HAC access to classified documents
                        or declassification criteria. When M, MO, and PA agreed to share additional
                        classified information with the HAC in advance of a June 14 meeting between
                        Redman and Perkins, the CDC appealed to Spiers. The Department’s
                        declassifiers attributed the HAC’s intransigence to HO, noting that “eight
                        years ago [Trask] used the HAC (and supporters in Congress) to lobby against
                        the Department’s declassification program after [the coordination] function
                        shifted from HO to CDC. . . . The Department was embarrassed, and suffered.”
                        CDC officials warned Spiers that “further accommodation . . . will only make
                        a bad situation worse for the Department” and predicted “that the Department
                        will suffer again” unless the HAC accepted that it must “serve the
                        Department’s expressed needs rather than the interests of the academic
                        organizations it represents.”<note place="foot" n="42"

                            members.”<note place="foot" n="47" xml:id="chapter-10fn47">To sustain
                            the constructive trajectory, he advised PA to begin laying the
                            groundwork to implement some of the MO suggestions by “sounding out the
                            American Economics Association and the Society of American Archivists on
                            their willingness to join the Committee.” If this was undertaken
                            alongside “careful preliminary discussions . . . with the existing
                            organizations represented,” PA could placate critics of the HAC within
                            the Department by broadening its scope without alienating existing
                            constituencies. See Slany to High, August 5, 1988, Department of State,

                            (1989–1990).</note> Slany’s optimism was misplaced. Despite the HAC’s
                        willingness to compromise, Spiers was tired of the protracted debate over
                        its role. In early July, he decided that the “whole area” of the
                        relationship between the CDC, HO, and the HAC “needs review. . . . Right now
                        it is entirely unsatisfactory &amp; I don’t trust any of the present players
                        fully. We need to look at objectives, procedures &amp; resources” to
                        determine the future of the Department’s <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        program. Spiers asked Carl Dillery, a trusted troubleshooter and deputy
                        chief of MO, for advice.<note place="foot" n="48" xml:id="chapter-10fn48"

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1007"/>A month later, Dillery counseled Spiers to “return
                        the [Committee] to a useful, constructive role.” He portrayed the Advisory
                        Committee as a “pressure group” reflecting a “‘publish or perish’ academic
                        environment” that “presented [Committee members] a clear conflict between
                        their advisory duties and their own professional interests, and put them in
                        an adversarial relationship with those responsible for safe-guarding
                        national security information.” Dillery suggested that the Department revise
                        the HAC charter to proscribe its “virtual obsession with the issue of
                        declassification,” remove its “PR function,” and broaden its membership “to
                        . . . promote challenge and debate rather than self-serving unanimity in the
                        HAC meetings.” Since “academicians have no special experience to qualify for
                        second guessing bureau desk officers or CDC professionals” on clearance
                        decisions, Dillery saw no reason to expand the Committee’s access to
                        classified material. To emphasize the stakes of the Department’s decisions
                        regarding the HAC, Dillery cited Miller’s letter to Glenn as “an indication
                        of how far the committee is willing to go in confronting the Department.”
                        Noting complaints to the Inspector General about Slany’s mismanagement
                        lodged by Deputy Historian Neal Petersen, he also wondered whether the
                        Department should conduct an Inspector General investigation or initiate “a
                        change in management direction” to prevent troubles within HO from
                        “undercut[ting] efforts to correct the HAC’s relationship with the
                            Department.”<note place="foot" n="49" xml:id="chapter-10fn49">Dillery to

                            Box 6, Sept. 16–20, 1988. The Inspector General did not undertake an
                            investigation of HO in 1988, though its 1990 report on PA concluded that
                            “it is time for far greater bureau oversight of and support for the
                            historian’s office.” The inspection identified “serious management
                            problems in PA/HO,” including “trouble engaging in prior planning,
                            meeting deadlines, utilizing staff efficiently, and communicating both
                            within HO and with other offices.” These deficiencies sapped staff
                            “trust and esprit . . . causing [HO] to register the lowest morale in
                            the entire bureau.” See “Report of Inspection: The Bureau of Public
                            Affairs,” October 1990, Department of State, ISP/I-91-2.</note> Just as
                        the CDC employed criticism of Slany’s management of HO to retaliate against
                        his support for the HAC, Dillery used Petersen’s complaints to undercut the
                        HO/HAC position. Spiers approved Dillery’s recommendations.<note

                        the Department” and doubt that “further efforts to satisfy the committee’s
                        requests . . . will solve the problem.” He advised PA to focus the HAC’s
                        attention on “substantive issues directly related to the content of the <hi

                        to revise the Committee’s charter in advance of the upcoming November HAC
                            meeting.<note place="foot" n="52" xml:id="chapter-10fn52">Spiers to

                        and comprehensive historical record.” This responsibility gave the HAC “a

                        months of work, his staff and PA “have been unable to agree on a set of
                        charter revisions and a strategy for achieving our objectives with the
                        committee.” During that time, however, Dillery had been “persuaded” by “PA’s
                        strong view . . . that the effort to change the charter would be
                        counter-productive and politically embarrassing.” Rather than risk public
                        relations problems, Dillery advised Spiers to take a wait-and-see approach.
                        If PA followed through on taking a “more assertive management role,” and if
                        parallel CDC efforts cultivated academic community confidence in its
                        activities, Dillery hoped, “we may have been through the worst of Committee
                        abuse of its position.” Nonetheless, he urged Spiers to give Redman a
                        “pointed reminder of his responsibility to manage the HAC in a way which
                        will minimize abuses.”<note place="foot" n="55" xml:id="chapter-10fn55"

                        Slany urged Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs George
                        Kennedy to participate as fully as possible so he could “set the tone of
                        what the Department wants from the Committee.” In that vein, Slany briefed
                        Kennedy on the CDC’s longstanding “sharp conflict with the Advisory
                        Committee.” He observed that “these relations have improved over the last
                        six months, thanks to some of the declassification leaders, but the
                        management of the issue requires constant attention.”<note place="foot"

                        of FPC, Eugene Bovis, had offered some degree of access to secret Department

                            that, according to Bovis, “the tone of the [August] meeting was
                            conciliatory but no commitment was made at that time to show the

                        Unfortunately, one of Bovis’s deputies scuttled this tentative resolution to
                        the HAC–Department feud. “Mr. [Richard] Morefield, the principal action
                        officer on the declassification of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        volumes,” Slany later reported, “decided that he after all did not have
                        authority to release classified documents to Committee chairman Cohen or
                        anyone else on the Committee” despite their security clearances.<note

                            account, Morefield and the FPC “determined” some time in the fall of
                            1989 “that for the Department to give permission [for the HAC to see
                            classified documents], three criteria had to be met: the Committee’s
                            need to know had to be established; the Committee’s level of security
                            clearance had to be defined (the Committee has only a Secret clearance);
                            the question of other agency permission for the Committee to look at
                            non-DOS documents had to be pinned down.” The FPC concluded “that there
                            was insufficient time before the November 1989 meeting to obtain for the
                            Committee a Top Secret clearance or to secure other agency clearances to
                            see non-DOS documents. Therefore, at best the Committee could see only
                            DOS documents which were Secret or Confidential.” See Glennon to

                        dialogue” that had arisen between the Department and the Committee in

                        two separate but interrelated challenges that highlighted HO’s untenable
                        position in the 1980s. First, Anglo-American consultation and collaboration
                        in addressing challenges posed to Western security and economic interests in
                        Iran had grown so close in 1952 and 1953 that it was impossible for <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilers to document U.S. policy without
                        including British equities. Secondly, this cooperation culminated in a
                        publicly-known covert operation that the United States Government did not
                        want to officially acknowledge. The sensitivity of relations with Iran
                        during and after the Islamic Revolution of 1978–1979 exacerbated both of
                        these problems. Policies to protect intelligence activities and records
                        containing sensitive foreign government information made it impossible for
                        the Department of State and the U.S. Government to publish an Iran volume
                        that conformed to <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> standards for responsible
                        historical transparency.</p>

                        considerations complicated their clearance and publication. The 1952–1954
                        compilation was completed by the end of 1976 and HO submitted it for

                        Amidst the turbulent strikes and mass protests that gripped Iran in the
                        autumn of 1978, U.S. officials confided to British policy planners that
                        “State Department records for the years between 1952 and 1954” were under
                        review for release, “with possibly damaging consequences for the UK as well
                        as the Shah.” Henry Precht, the Department of State country director for
                        Iran, warned that the documents, “if released[,] . . . would [have] some

                        January 1981, the Department resumed mandatory and systematic clearance
                        reviews of Iran-related materials, including the two postponed <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilations. Henry Precht co-drafted clearance
                        guidelines that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs
                        (NEA) Peter Constable forwarded to Clayton McManaway and CDC on February 10,
                        1981. The first of NEA’s guidelines was “no release of documents that would
                        reveal intelligence sources, methods, plans or operations.” NEA also
                        identified specific goals for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. Noting that “a
                        simplified and distorted version of the events of this period has become
                        political dogma in Iran and elsewhere,” the guidelines expressed hope that
                        “the release of the full diplomatic record would help provide a better
                        balance in accounts of our role.” Reflecting Precht’s earlier conversations
                        with the British, however, NEA advised that “it will be essential to cover
                        our dealings with the British. To exclude the story of US–British
                        cooperation on Iran will not give a true picture of US decisions. We suggest
                        that the Department consult with the FCO [U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth
                        Office] to work out practical arrangements for possible release of documents
                        from this record.”<note place="foot" n="74" xml:id="chapter-10fn74">Peter

                        place in July 1981 under the procedures for clearing FGI established in the
                        aftermath of the 1980 re-review. In a meeting with British diplomats and
                        declassification reviewers, CDC and EUR officials explained that, in their
                        review of the Iran compilations for 1951 and 1952–1954, “we are concerned
                        partly about the possible impact on our relations with Iran in the future.
                        But even more than that, we are concerned to avoid possible ill effects on
                        our close relationship with the UK.” Echoing the NEA guidelines, they
                        admitted “it would be virtually impossible to give a fair and comprehensive
                        report on our own role without revealing the British role as well. Given the
                        closeness of our liaison during this period, coupled with ubiquitous
                        evidence of our disagreements,” the U.S. participants hoped consultation
                        would allow both countries to protect contemporary interests and
                        relationships. The Americans invited their British counterparts to veto
                        publication of material that the Department already knew London preferred
                        not to see published.<note place="foot" n="75" xml:id="chapter-10fn75"

                        records. Historian Nina Noring confirmed that documenting U.S. policy toward
                        Iran from 1952 to 1954 required telling the British story. “Even before the
                        Brits were kicked out of Iran,” she explained, “the 2 countries were working
                        almost as 1 team to resolve the oil dispute, with numerous documents being
                        passed back &amp; forth, joint reports being written by the 2 Ambassadors in
                        Tehran, with the result that many US docs were incomprehensible w/out seeing
                        Brit docs.” Noring described the British records as “looking at the same

                            Government Printing Office. The NSC did not respond until the summer of
                            1988, when it made additional excisions to four documents to remove
                            “very sensitive” information and protect issues “currently under review
                            and/or discussion.” In response to HAC criticism of the volume after it
                            was released, Glennon implied that the CIA review eliminated material
                            (provided by the Agency) that corroborated Kermit Roosevelt’s account of
                            the covert operation against Mossadeq in <hi rend="italic">Countercoup:

                        the precedent of the Guatemala volume by including a disclaimer in the
                        incomplete Iran volume. In its 1988 report to the Secretary of State, the
                        HAC had registered its “uneasiness about how well the series will represent
                        the reality of American foreign relations when the bulk of covert actions .
                        . . is omitted.” When documentation of a significant covert operation could
                        not be printed in a <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume, the HAC demanded,
                        “at [a] minimum, . . . a disclaimer in the published volume indicating that
                        operations beyond the purview of the Department . . . were involved.” The
                        HAC warned that “to do less would approach fraud—and subvert the credibility
                        of the series.”<note place="foot" n="91" xml:id="chapter-10fn91">Report of

                        transparency and accelerate the series during the 1980s. Between 1978 and
                        1984, Department officers in geographic bureaus and the CDC made judgments
                        about the sensitivity of historical documents and the necessity of
                        consultation with the British that eviscerated the Iran volume. The
                        Department’s self-censorship exemplified, but also obscured, the restrictive
                        impulses toward historical transparency that prevailed throughout the U.S.
                        Government. During the 1980s, declassification reviewers in other federal
                        agencies such as the CIA, Department of Defense, and NSC did not have to
                        apply a very heavy hand to sanitize documents already excised by State
                        reviewers. At the same time, the Department’s transfer of the interagency
                        declassification coordination function from HO to the CDC in 1981 left <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians and the HAC uninformed about who made
                        critical decisions. After blame settled—incorrectly—on the CIA, HO and the
                        HAC misapprehended the source of the problems they encountered during the
                        1980s, which later contributed to unrealistic hopes for the solutions
                        devised in 1991. <anchor xml:id="b_1578-end" corresp="#b_1578-start"/>

                        their efforts to promote greater openness in the 1980s. They should have
                        recognized that the Iran volume was too incomplete to be published without
                        damaging the series’s reputation, consulted with stakeholders across the
                        government and the academic community, and devised alternatives to releasing
                        an unacceptable volume. Instead, HO pursued the tantalizing prospect of
                        accelerating <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> offered by the staff study and the
                        Presidential directive. By the mid-1980s, Department of State historians
                        embraced a program of publishing incomplete volumes to improve the
                        timeliness of the series. Their efforts to satisfy the academic community’s
                        demands to accelerate the series incrementally compromised the integrity of

                        meeting began smoothly. At the outset of the first session, Warren Cohen
                        “thanked Mr. Bovis and Mr. Morefield for being cooperative in past
                        misunderstandings regarding the classification/declassification procedures.”
                        The FPC’s briefing during the afternoon session also proceeded smoothly
                        until Cohen “asked if he could see the documents which were described in
                        this session, those that were not Top Secret or other-agency documents.”
                        Morefield responded negatively. He reported that “the Committee had only
                        Secret clearances, and most of these documents were Top Secret and
                        non-Department of State documents. All the Committee would be able to see
                        were just a few of the least impressive [documents] and he was not sanguine
                        that they could see even these.” Cohen immediately objected that HDR’s
                        response violated “the bargain that had been struck with the Department” and
                        “stressed that the integrity of the series demanded that the Committee
                        insist on seeing these deletions.” Morefield ultimately refused to provide
                        the HAC access to any denied materials during the meeting.<note place="foot"

                            that the Committee’s security clearance was incomplete, and finally
                            explained that it lacked authority to provide the expected access.”

                        Cohen’s outrage at the FPC’s refusal to allow the HAC to assess the
                        integrity of the series. The volume’s failure to document U.S. involvement
                        in the overthrow of Mossadeq was exactly the kind of damaging gap in <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s comprehensiveness that the HAC had worried
                        about since the implementation of the acceleration plan in 1986. The
                        volume’s publication redoubled the Committee’s determination to play a
                        stronger role in assessing volumes before publication, either to urge HO to
                        delay incomplete volumes until more favorable clearance decisions could be
                        secured or to insist that they include disclaimers that could provide
                        marginal protection for the general reputation of the series. The FPC’s
                        retreat from the muddled assurances that it had offered Cohen during the

                        of public policy and history at Duke University, to review the volume.
                        Kuniholm “concluded that the publication of . . . a seriously misleading
                        account of U.S. relations with Iran at a critical juncture constituted
                        ‘something like fraud’ by the Department of State.” He thought the Iran
                        volume “called into question the credibility as well as the purpose of the
                        series.” The HAC “generally applauded and concurred in . . . Kuniholm’s
                        assessment of the volume.” Cohen “agreed that the volume was badly flawed”
                        and worried “about the impact on the series as a whole of publishing
                        obviously misleading accounts.” Committee member Ronald Spector raised “a
                        fundamental decision for the Department: whether or not to claim [<hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>] is a complete record of U.S. foreign policy.”
                        Cohen concluded that the Committee “had to let the Secretary know that this
                        was a serious problem which was undermining the series. The purpose of the
                        series is to give the American people an accurate record of U.S. foreign
                        policy. It is essential to warn the reader that important aspects are not
                            included.”<note place="foot" n="97" xml:id="chapter-10fn97">During the
                            HAC meeting, Glennon defended the volume, arguing that “the volume does
                            contain good material” and that “the Guatemala compilation was far less
                            complete than the Iran volume.” When Kuniholm published an expanded
                            version of his criticism of the Iran volume in the spring of 1990 (after
                            Cohen’s resignation from the HAC), he concluded “the misleading
                            impression of U.S. non-involvement conveyed in the pages of the volume
                            constitutes a gross misrepresentation of the historical record
                            sufficient to deserve the label of fraud.” See minutes of 1989 HAC

                        demands. Instead, FPC advised HO to try new approaches to cultivate academic
                        support for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, including a “major outreach effort

                            xml:id="chapter-10fn100">Regarding the outreach effort, Slany informed
                            PA that the FPC proposal ignored an uncomfortable fact: “the main source
                            of negative comment about Department declassification probably comes
                            from PA/HO staff,” which he “very strictly controlled . . . to prevent a
                            worsening of the reputations of the Department declassifiers.” Slany
                            also reported that the proposed Presidential directive was “the best of
                            the proposals, providing we take the occasion to modernize and reduce
                            the process of preparing and publishing <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                Relations</hi> volumes into a realistic undertaking.” This would
                            require a “detailed Staff Study . . . that defines the full range of
                            implications, especially resources, for the modernized, slimmed down,
                            and accelerated <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.” This
                            reaction to the Presidential directive suggestion is telling. After
                            hearing Kuniholm denounce the Iran volume as a fraud in November—but
                            before the avalanche of criticism that followed Cohen’s resignation in
                            February—Slany still prioritized improving the timeliness of the series
                            over ensuring its comprehensiveness and integrity. See Slany to Kennedy,

                        has only led to new requests . . . and to bad feelings which detract from .

                            >On January 24, Slany predicted that “Cohen is likely to resign,” to
                            “place an op-ed piece in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> or
                            similar newspapers,” and to “rally academic representatives to make
                            contacts with Congressmen or their staff members.” He anticipated,
                            incorrectly, that a vigorous Department “counter effort” focusing on the
                            “current status of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series
                            and the importance of plans for its future can largely defuse the worst
                            of the criticisms.” He expected “the damage to the Department or [<hi
                                rend="italic">FRUS</hi>] by such public airing of Prof. Cohen’s
                            dispute with the declassifiers will probably be greater within the
                            Department than outside” since “the declassifiers may see Prof. Cohen’s
                            complaints and concerns as a justification for less rather than more
                            effective efforts to inform the Advisory Committee about the essential
                            soundness of Department declassification procedures.” See Slany through

                    <p>By early 1990, the Department could no longer evade its fundamental
                        disagreement with the HAC. Department declassifiers and management staffers
                        regarded any Committee involvement in declassification policy as
                        illegitimate. They also insisted that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>—and the
                        historical record—had to conform to security requirements established by
                        Presidential order, statute, and Departmental regulations that they
                        purported left no room for subjective judgments. PA, HO, and the HAC
                        rejected this conception. Although they agreed that legitimate security
                        concerns should determine what and when information could safely be
                        released, HO and the HAC rejected that such determinations could be made
                        arbitrarily, without regard for the integrity of the official U.S.
                        Government record of its foreign policy. They also insisted that responsible
                        historical transparency required outside oversight and advice. No middle
                        ground remained between these two diametrically opposed positions.</p>

                        February 15, 1990. He informed Secretary of State James Baker that “the
                        Department has reneged on the agreement I spent two years negotiating and
                        undermined my credibility with the professional organization[s] to whom I
                        report. The entire process by which the committee attempts to serve the
                        Department by insuring the integrity of the historical record has been
                        brought into question.” Recent developments convinced Cohen that “the <hi

                        most respected diplomatic record in the world, has been compromised—and the
                        Committee has been denied the means to remedy the situation.” Under such
                        circumstances, neither he nor the other members of the Committee could
                        “protect the integrity of the series, the reputation of the Department, or
                        testify to the concern of this administration for providing an honest

                        over the HAC’s access to classified information and explaining “the

                        questioned, “in the absence of an acceptable response from the Department, .

                            the AHA annual meeting in 1990, when she entreated listeners, “if we

                            continue . . . we have very narrow choices. We must insist on its

                        to terminate the Committee. “In addition to recording continuing management

                        raise the possibility of legal issues.” Dillery implied that the Committee

                        agencies.” He also used HO’s past arguments that the HAC served an important
                        public relations function against the Committee by asking whether the public

                        maneuver against the HAC in 1990. Cohen’s resignation and criticism of the
                        Iran volume garnered more public attention for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        than the series had received since the release of the Yalta Papers in 1955.
                        Unlike the Yalta episode, the publicity surrounding <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> in 1990 transcended partisan divisions. The furor also
                        reflected the success of academic initiatives to shape public discourse. The
                        Department’s initial responses to critical letters, editorials, articles,
                        and resolutions reflected the erosion of transparency during the previous
                        decade; Department officials remained reactive, defensive, and discordant
                        with mounting public skepticism about government secrecy.<anchor

                        criticism of the Department. In March, the OAH, SHAFR, the NCCPH, and the
                        AHA adopted a joint resolution expressing concern about “changes during the
                        last decade in the editorial review process for handling sensitive material”
                        that caused an “appalling increase in the amount of incomplete and deleted
                        documents” in recent <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes. The resolution
                        urged the Department to empower the HAC and “restore the integrity” of the

                        were more effective in pressing their views in the Department’s response to
                        the May 16 <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> editorial. Their reply,
                        drafted before the introduction of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> legislation
                        in the Senate, explained that the Department’s transparency program
                        “provided richness and detail about United States foreign policy to
                        historians, political scientists, and interested citizens unmatched by any
                        other government.” It also argued that “even after 30 years, many foreign
                        policy issues remain remarkably alive and tied to present activities.”
                        Without careful review and judicious constraints on openness, “releasing
                        sensitive information—even from decades ago—may adversely affect our ability
                        to do business with [other] countries and to advance our national
                        interests.” The response concluded that statutory exemption of CIA

                        outside intervention. When Congress acted in 1990, the Department belatedly
                        undertook efforts to redeem the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        series to preempt legislation. In a 1993 oral history interview, former
                        Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs George High
                        criticized officials like Dillery and the leadership of the FPC for
                        “represent[ing] a point of view and philosophy reflecting what American
                        values were back in the 1950s, not the realities of the late 1980s.” Misled
                        by outdated expectations that the public would defer to their claims of
                        national security imperatives, “the Department’s leadership failed to
                        recognize its weakness.” Because of this overconfidence and misperception of
                        public attitudes, High explained, “the whole matter went to Congress” and
                        “the historians’ demands were passed into legislation. . . . The Department
                        got the worst of all worlds. Now it is required by law to release
                        information it sought to withhold.”<note place="foot" n="127"

                        appropriate contours of responsible historical transparency. As Congress
                        cited the remarkable geopolitical changes unfolding in Eastern Europe and
                        the Soviet Union to legislate greater openness, Department historians
                        shifted from accelerating <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> by limiting its scope
                        to prioritizing the comprehensiveness and integrity of the series. These
                        developments alarmed Department officials responsible for declassification
                        policy. Throughout 1990 and 1991, the Office of Freedom of Information,
                        Privacy, and Classification Review (FPC) and its Historical Documents Review
                        branch (HDR) mounted a futile defense of unaccountable secrecy against
                        pro-transparency forces inside and outside the Department. Accustomed to
                        winning bureaucratic struggles insulated from public scrutiny, the
                        Department’s declassifiers were largely—but not entirely—disarmed by the

                        line. Over the next year and a half, Congress significantly modified other
                        elements of the Pell Amendment, but this core remained intact. The amendment
                        also employed language from the original 1925 Kellogg Order to require “the
                        editing of the record . . . to be guided by the principles of historical
                        objectivity and accuracy.” Throughout the legislative process, Congress

                        however, Congress displayed flexibility about the means it prescribed to
                        achieve those ends. The initial Pell Amendment defined a very narrow range
                        of declassification exemptions; only details about weapons and cryptographic
                        systems and the identity of intelligence sources received automatic
                        protection from disclosure. Such a constricted definition of presumed
                        secrets would have created a radically different declassification system
                        within the Department: all other excisions from <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        would require HAC approval. In effect, the original Pell Amendment would
                        have transformed the Committee from an advisory body into a declassification
                        authority. Although the Pell Amendment responded to public criticism of the
                        Iran volume, it focused far more on settling the conflict between the
                        Department and the HAC in favor of the Committee.<note place="foot" n="4"

                        to address its <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> problem. As the HAC collaborated

                        and congressional assessments of the Department’s plans for the future of
                        the series assumed decisive importance. Department officials hoped that
                        their proposed reforms could preserve vital national interests, placate the
                        academic community, and avert congressional intervention. Even before the

                        constrained the Department’s flexibility in adapting the series for the
                        post-Cold War era. On the same day that Pell introduced his amendment, Slany
                        expressed hope to HAC member Bradford Perkins that, if “top people in

                        “civil war in the Department,” complicated efforts to placate critics and
                        forestall congressional intervention. To the academic community and to
                        Congress, the “fraudulent” Iran volume and the HAC’s lack of access to
                        classified information were equally serious issues. For these <hi

                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> problem would have to provide for HO’s access to
                        (and ability to declassify) sensitive intelligence documentation and confirm
                        the HAC’s role in ensuring the integrity of the series. Within the
                        Department, HO initially focused on reinvigorating its <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> acceleration efforts and mitigating the damage caused by the
                        breakdown in the Department’s relationship with the HAC. As external
                        criticism mounted, however, HO exploited outside pressure to lobby for
                        longstanding objectives: expanded access to other-agency records and
                        liberalization of the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> declassification process.
                        The public outcry about the Iran volume and Cohen’s resignation shifted HO’s
                        attention from improving the timeliness of the series to assuring its

                        Diplomatic Security (which oversaw the declassification staff during this
                        period) Sheldon Krys argued in the summer of 1990, <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi>’s consumers needed to “look at the issue with a somewhat

                        promoting greater transparency, altered internal dynamics also played a
                        critical role. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Margaret
                        Tutwiler was much closer to Secretary of State James Baker than any of her

                        bureaucratic clout in 1990 and 1991 than during the 1980s. Under Secretary

                        reached or even drawn nearer the 30-year line,” but “questions and concerns

                        proper vehicle for the systematic official disclosure of the main lines of
                        American foreign policy in its proper historical context.” It required other
                        government agencies to “facilitate necessary access to their historical
                        records” and then “accord necessary priority” to the declassification of
                        selected documents “to move toward and achieve a date-certain of 30 years
                        for public release.” Finally, the draft directive ordered the Secretary of
                        State to “maintain a suitable advisory process . . . to assure that the
                        published record adheres to generally accepted standards.” These
                        pro-transparency additions notwithstanding, HO’s staff study placed its
                        hopes for protecting the future of the series upon the same ephemeral
                        Executive branch mandates to improve interagency cooperation that had failed

                        Moreover, they dismissed HO’s approach as “exaggerat[ing] the need of the
                        public to be informed about its foreign affairs past.” HDR believed that “a
                        50-year line would be as useful as a 30-year line for release.” HDR wanted
                        the HAC “muzzled and reorganized in order to narrow drastically its mandate”
                        since the Committee had “no business making judgments about the accuracy or

                        the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> problem, HDR predicted that “it will take

                        all of its recommendations focused on improving <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi>’s comprehensiveness, not its timeliness. The plan addressed four
                        elements of the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> production process implicated in
                        complaints about the “accuracy and completeness of the record”: broadening
                        interagency research access, reforming the declassification process,
                        providing editorial mechanisms for identifying and explaining omissions
                        within the volumes, and expanding HAC access to classified material. Slany
                        envisioned a multifaceted solution to the access problem. For most agencies,
                        a Presidential memorandum would suffice to ensure requisite HO access. For
                        the CIA, Slany described a cooperative arrangement with Agency historians
                        that would obviate the need for Department of State historians to access CIA
                        archives directly. He also proposed expanding documentation of Congress’s
                        role in the foreign policy process. To reform the declassification system,
                        Slany proposed expanding <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians’ role in the
                        declassification coordination function by reversing the changes that had
                        been made following the 1980 re-review. He also suggested empowering an
                        ombudsman to oversee the Department’s declassification system. To make the
                        extent of excisions and deletions more apparent to <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> consumers, Slany promised expanded prefaces, “precise
                        accounting” of omissions within documents, and improved unclassified
                        summaries of documents that could not be declassified. Finally, the plan
                        called for the HAC to review clearance denials and excisions so that it
                        could evaluate the integrity of the series.<note place="foot" n="18"

                        during the summer of 1990, an interagency consensus arose that the Pell
                        Amendment posed significant constitutional and functional problems for
                        effectively conducting foreign relations and safeguarding national security.
                        FPC/HDR predicted that, if enacted, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> legislation
                        along the lines of the Pell Amendment would “pose serious operational and
                        practical difficulties for the Department.” Declassifiers complained that
                        the Pell Amendment’s “limited grounds” for exempting information from
                        declassification “pertain[ed] to only some aspects of national security,”
                        were “overly vague and open-ended,” and “conflict[ed] with other laws.” They
                        also worried that the law would “result in a fundamental change in the whole
                        information security system, which would become, in effect,
                        ‘declassification by default.’” Finally, FPC/HDR cautioned against
                        augmenting the role of the HAC, whose members would find both the security
                        procedures and the time commitment required to fulfill its new mandate too
                        onerous. They warned that, “in the last three years[,] there have been at

                        about the feasibility and wisdom of Slany’s alternative. Initial reactions
                        to the HO action plan within the Department reflected predictable
                        bureaucratic priorities. Richard Mueller, whose principal objective as

                        Congress, thought Slany’s plan offered “basically the right direction.”

                        allegation that the Department reneged on a promise to show the Committee
                        classified material, but this language was removed after a “session with
                        Bovis” that left Dwight Ambach “less than amused” about what his predecessor
                        had offered the HAC in the summer of 1989. The declassification staff also
                        thought better of the draft’s argument that HAC’s criticism of the Iran
                        volume proved that the Committee didn’t need additional access to make
                        judgments about the integrity of the series. While their final letter (which
                        the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Service Journal</hi> published in November
                        1990) was less polemical than these early drafts, HDR remained oblivious
                        about public expectations for openness. HDR recommended that the HAC focus
                        upon its core competency, which was “advising on major substantive questions
                        such as the kinds of issues that should be given priority in the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> of the future”—not assessing the integrity or
                        comprehensiveness of the declassification process. When Cohen responded to
                        their letter in the February 1991 issue, he concluded that, “by revealing
                        their inability to recognize the gravity of the [<hi rend="italic"

                        required by security. . . . The historical record must be compiled from

                                >FRUS</hi> plan turned on whether the declassification process
                            required reform. PA’s draft called for those deciding appeals to balance
                            security with the integrity of the historical record, placed
                            responsibility on other agencies to provide substitute documents or
                            summaries for information that had to be omitted for security reasons,
                            and proposed more robust Departmental oversight for declassification
                            review. FPC’s draft affirmed the adequacy of existing procedures and
                            made no reference to the value of responsible transparency or the
                            integrity of the historical record. Following closely on the heels of

                        only way to avoid congressional interference with Departmental (and
                        executive branch) prerogatives was to offer the HAC a satisfactory action
                        plan so the Committee would endorse the Department’s position. <anchor

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_1035"/>For FPC and FMP, the situation was more problematic.
                        Although these officials shared the broader goal of avoiding congressional
                        intervention, they believed that the compromises required to placate the HAC
                        posed their own intolerable operational risks and management problems.
                        Richard Morefield coordinated with L and FMP to devise a “mutually
                        acceptable” response to HO. Their criticisms focused on the constitutional
                        issues at stake and they asserted that security requirements trumped the
                        integrity of the historical record and any conceivable HAC responsibility. L
                        maintained that “classification and declassification decisions are functions
                        of the Executive Branch, and committee members have neither the requisite
                        experiences nor expertise with national security matters to engage in such

                        the 101st Congress adjourned. Her letter criticized the statute’s
                        “derogation from the uniform government-wide classification system,”
                        especially its failure to account for statutory protections for several

                        declassification review body” whose encroachments on Presidential powers
                        “would raise serious constitutional questions.” Mullins’s letter assured

                        lunch. During this meeting, Selin offered the HAC two significant
                        concessions that the Department’s declassification reviewers and management
                        advisers had vigorously resisted throughout the 1980s: “the Advisory
                        Committee would receive the necessary clearances and ‘need to know’ to
                        review documents withheld from <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        volumes” and “the Advisory Committee’s mandate extended beyond the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series itself to the larger body of
                        Department documents permanently preserved at the National Archives.”
                        Related to the latter, Selin “acknowledged that the Committee’s access to
                        the Department’s relevant systematic review declassification guidelines was
                        necessary to allow it to fully evaluate the accuracy and completeness” of
                        the historical record. Selin hoped that his acceptance of the HAC’s demands
                        would obviate further consideration of the Senate’s <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> legislation, but his intervention established a baseline for
                        HAC expectations that went beyond anything the FPC and FMP considered
                            acceptable.<note place="foot" n="46" xml:id="chapter-11fn46">Minutes of

                        <anchor xml:id="b_671"/>The next day, the Committee encountered two starkly
                        different views of the U.S. Government’s responsibility to inform the
                        American people of its historical actions. Richard Morefield repeated
                        familiar arguments that declassification resided outside the HAC’s purview
                        and tried to deflect blame for declassification delays from FPC to HO.
                        Morefield’s rigidity alienated the Committee at the worst possible moment,
                        just before a discussion on the status of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        legislation with key congressional staffers Frank Sieverts (Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee) and James Currie (Senate Select Committee on
                        Intelligence). Sieverts explained that Senators Pell, Boren, William Cohen,
                        and Jesse Helms feared that, without a legislative mandate for <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, both the standards and existence of the series
                        remained vulnerable to the whims of the Executive Branch. They wanted to
                        “make both <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> and the existence of the
                        Committee a matter of law.” Currie ridiculed the Department’s objections to
                        the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute, characterizing Mullins’s October 25
                        letter as “hyperbolic” and “paranoid.” Borrowing the rhetoric of Senator
                        Helms, Sieverts described the Department’s “present system of
                        declassification . . . as ‘corporate statism’” while the legislation
                        “envisioned a ‘free enterprise’ approach in which private scholars would
                        take control.”<note place="foot" n="47" xml:id="chapter-11fn47">The meeting
                            minutes record “general awe that Sieverts had managed to hit the
                            appropriate ideological buttons with [this] analogy.” See minutes of
                            1990 HAC meeting, p. 23, Department of State, PA Lot File 93D287, Box 1,

                            (11/15–16).</note> Both staffers emphasized that the legislation would
                        greatly expand access to other-agency documentation for the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series. Currie assured the HAC that its proposed
                        role in the Department’s declassification activities would focus on
                        overseeing review procedures rather than evaluating individual documents. In
                        response to HAC concerns that a legislative mandate would constrain efforts
                        to reform <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, Sieverts responded that Congress was
                        primarily concerned with assuring the series’s future. Although prompt
                        Department action could obviate congressional micromanagement, Sieverts
                        informed the Committee and the Department that “<hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> needed a legislative mandate; thus, [Congress] intended
                        to go forward with the legislation. Important declassification and <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> goals,” he concluded, “belong in
                        the law.”<note place="foot" n="48" xml:id="chapter-11fn48">Minutes of 1990

                        meeting convinced PA that legislation was inevitable. Early in December,
                        Hoggard issued a stark warning to Selin: failure to deal with the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> problem could threaten the credibility of the
                        entire executive branch. She predicted that, if “public criticism of the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> continue at the boisterous level it has already
                        attained, . . . its target [could] shift to the Secretary in such a manner
                        as to question his commitment (and that of the Administration’s [sic]) to
                        provide accurate and complete information to the public.” In turning to
                        Selin for high-level support for PA’s solution to the <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> problem, Hoggard reported that “bureaucratic foot-dragging
                        has impeded any hope of getting Department-approved proposed legislation to
                        the Hill in the new year without your impetus.” In the previous year, she
                        lamented, “the Department incorrectly thought that ‘if you ignore it, it
                        will go away’” only to discover that “Congressional oversight . . . [and]
                        the Historical Advisory Committee [are] fact[s] of life. The Department,”
                        she argued, “must accept these realities and make them work to our
                            advantage.”<note place="foot" n="49" xml:id="chapter-11fn49">Hoggard to

                    </p>
                    <p>Hoggard offered a four-part strategy to neutralize the <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> problem. First, Selin had to approve the long-delayed action
                        plan. The Department should also propose a Presidential memorandum, which
                        Senate staffers suggested “could” deflect congressional action, to “direct
                        relevant agencies to cooperate with the Department in assembling,
                        declassifying, and publishing” the series. To strengthen its leverage on the
                        Hill, Selin should change tactics and “express support for the general
                        objectives of the pending legislation, willingness to have some general
                        legislative mandate for the . . . series, but offer the Department’s [<hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> modernization program] as the only appropriate
                        and workable way of dealing with the operational aspects of assuring an
                        accurate and complete published historical record.” Finally, the Department
                        had to expedite additional clearances for the HAC so it could undertake its
                        “heightened responsibilities to verify” the integrity of <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi>.<note place="foot" n="50" xml:id="chapter-11fn50">Hoggard to

                            Richard Morefield characterized it as “particularly egregious—perhaps
                            the most distorted to date.” He described it as “gloss[ing] over PA’s
                            previous positions that have proven disastrous, misrepresent[ing] our
                            positions, . . . and “show[ing] a complete disregard for what the

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1021"/>The next day, Hoggard and Tutwiler met with the new
                        HAC Chair, Warren Kimball, to inform the Advisory Committee of their
                        strategy for resolving the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> problem. Kimball
                        reported to the rest of the Committee that PA and Selin “believe that
                        legislation is so likely that they want to work with Congress to improve the
                        bill.” PA explained that it had designed its plan to “fit into a broader
                        piece of legislation that could (should?) include in it a legislative
                        mandate for (1) the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series . . . , (2) the
                        existence of our HAC, and (3) ‘automatic’ declassification of State
                        Department documents after 30 years (always within the limitations
                        established by other legislation).” Kimball responded that the HAC would
                        likely support the formula of “legislation that established principles . . .
                        combined with procedures and regulations developed internally by the
                        Department to implement those principles.” He also clarified that the HAC
                        intended to focus on “assuring the public of the integrity of the process”
                        for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> production and the declassification and
                        transfer of records to NARA rather than “provide any sort of ‘imprimatur’
                        for either the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series or any specific volume.”
                        To his colleagues on the HAC, Kimball observed “bureaucracies seem to have
                        two speeds—all stop and all ahead flank. For the moment, this matter seems
                        to have rung up the latter.”<note place="foot" n="51"

                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> plan, FPC worked to convince Frank Sieverts that
                        the proposed <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> legislation was a mistake. Over
                        lunch on December 20, several HDR reviewers explained the declassification
                        process in greater detail. They emphasized the impossibility of “automatic”
                        declassification and the relationship between declassification review for
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> and the preparation of systematic review
                        guidelines for use at NARA. Although William Hamilton expressed hope that
                        Sieverts “might be a voice of moderation in Hill discussions if the House
                        can be influenced toward modification [of the existing Senate language],” he
                        judged that the Senate staffer “still believed that ‘historians’ are right
                        to have greater say in what can properly be released—they are the source of
                        Olympian judgments above partisan or bureaucratic constraints.” Charles
                        Flowerree added that Sieverts had confided that “what the historians really
                        wanted was access to the files at NARA at the 30 year line. The <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> dust-up was just a convenient way of getting at

                        <anchor xml:id="b_668"/>In January 1991, Selin directed Roger Gamble and
                        Ambassador Barrington King, troubleshooters in FMP, to “forge a consensus on
                        the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> plan and on how to deal with Capitol Hill.”
                        In late January and early February, King narrowed the differences between HO
                        and HDR so that the Department could begin “planning and executing a
                        congressional strategy.” FMP finally recognized that the Department’s
                        strategy “required “mend[ing] our fences with the Advisory Committee” and
                        enlisting their support. With backing from the Committee, King hoped that
                        the Department could persuade the Senate to “drop the two most objectionable
                        features of the Pell legislation: a cumbersome statutory advisory committee
                        and the requirement that the Department’s records be automatically
                        declassified after thirty years.” Selin endorsed King’s strategy on January
                            22.<note place="foot" n="53" xml:id="chapter-11fn53">Kent to Selin,

                        implemented the Department’s congressional strategy. At a House Foreign
                        Affairs subcommittee meeting on February 27, he argued that “the right thing
                        on [resolving the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> controversy] was not what [the
                        Senate] passed” but accepted that the “concern of the [Senate Foreign
                        Relations] Committee was . . . completely justified.” Selin admitted the
                        Department had “not [been] doing the right thing on all this” and embraced
                        the HAC’s need to have access to withheld classified material to evaluate
                        the integrity of the publishable record. He also assured the subcommittee
                        that the Department was working “to speed up the process by which documents
                        are declassified and to put a stronger onus on any agency that cares not to
                        declassify a document.” Concluding his remarks on the Department’s <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> plan, the Under Secretary reported that he
                        “personally had been rather deeply involved in this question, because it
                        struck me as a tempest in a teapot, and I couldn’t understand why, when it
                        was such an obviously sensible position—I couldn’t understand why we didn’t
                        get there. So I have spent a lot of time myself in being the catalyst to
                        bring this to the place where it is now.”<note place="foot" n="59"

                            >FRUS</hi> statute took shape during the spring and summer of 1991.
                        Despite PA and M acceptance of the inevitability of legislation, FPC sought
                        support from bureaucratic allies elsewhere in the executive branch for a
                        presidential veto of any <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute that did not
                        conform to the existing declassification regime. Despite NSC opposition to
                        the proposed legislation, the Department moved on to quibbling over details
                        in the House and Senate versions of the statute by the end of the summer.
                        After Congress reconciled the House and Senate versions and passed the bill
                        containing the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute in October, President
                        Bush issued a signing statement asserting presidential authority over
                        decisionmaking regarding national security secrecy. Although the <hi

                        previous decade’s erosion of openness, additional work had to be completed

                        Hoggard reported to Selin that the Committee was “extremely pleased with and

                        regarding the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,” HAC members
                        actually spent most of the March 13 meeting asking tough questions about how
                        the action plan could work without additional legislative endorsement.<note

                            Plan.</note> In FMP and FPC accounts of the meeting, the HAC dismissed
                        the Department’s action plan. Kimball opened the meeting by saying that
                        “part of the Department’s plan was window dressing and other parts did not
                        interest the committee.” He reported that he “consulted five past chairmen
                        of this committee and while they like the [Department] plan, they are
                        skeptical about chances for its implementation.” Recalling how “previous
                        Presidential memos . . . have been quickly discarded or forgotten,” Kimball
                        regarded this approach as a “cliché.” Committee members suspected “that a
                        Presidential memorandum will not have any effect on CIA or DOD.” They
                        believed that legislation would compel interagency cooperation for <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> more effectively than another round of carefully
                        hedged Presidential exhortation. With fresh memories of the Department
                        contemplating “abolishing the Committee,” HAC members also insisted that
                        “their responsibilities must be established in law, lest . . . the current
                        favorable environment shift in the future.” By the end of the meeting, “no
                        one [on the Committee] opposed the view that some kind of basic legislation
                        . . . was necessary to formally sanction the role of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> and the mandate of the advisory committee and its members.”
                        William Hamilton reflected that “the hole into which FPC has fallen seems
                        deeper and without any firm bottom.”<note place="foot" n="61"

                        legislation marginally more appealing to <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s
                        critics. In response to “Administration concerns” echoing two centuries of
                        debate over “constitutional issues relating to the exercise of executive
                        functions, protection of national security, and potential claims of
                        executive privilege,” the House added a “Presidential privilege” to its
                        version of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> legislation that could be used in
                        “exceptional circumstances” to “preserve the integrity of the . . .
                        deliberative process.” The House also affirmed that the declassification
                        procedures of the legislation would be “subject to existing legal standards
                        for the protection of classified information. Thus, records selected for
                        inclusion in the series should be declassified unless existing law requires
                        that they remain classified.” Although the HAC would receive security
                        clearances needed to make a “valid judgment about what should be included in
                        the publication,” it would not serve as the declassification appeals body
                        envisioned by the Pell Amendment. The House imposed a reporting requirement
                        for improving the Department’s existing systematic declassification program,
                        an important difference from the Senate’s more assertive stance of defining
                        exemption criteria and mandating deadlines.<note place="foot" n="66"

                        finally accepted that it was “clearly too late to delay or derail the

                        procedures, “maintain flexibility in the prescribed 30-year timeline” for

                            not oppose the 30-year line in principle, but wanted to avoid a “rigid
                            30-year rule” that would preclude the possibility of delaying
                            publication to include “important information,” which “may permit a
                            higher quality <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to be published.” The FPC
                            cited “recent changes in the USSR and Eastern Europe” as an example of a
                            catalyst for a “re-review” that could “permit the release of information
                            that could not be released earlier.” While the 1991 re-review differed
                            from its 1980 forerunner in enabling substantive gains (rather than
                            losses) for the series, it illustrated that accepting timeliness costs
                            could improve comprehensiveness. See D[wight] R A[mbach] memorandum,

                        their access to classified documents withheld from <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi>, they deferred making a formal protest after learning of the
                        tight time constraints involved in securing the necessary Departmental and
                        NSC clearances for this meeting. Despite the Committee’s inability to review
                        documents withheld from the Japan, 1958–1960 compilation, HO and FPC alerted
                        the Committee that even clearing a substantive disclaimer for the volume
                        would be difficult. Morefield confided that “the Department would not be
                        able to print this volume for the foreseeable future” owing to “concern”
                        that publishing material about “nuclear weapons and status of forces” might
                        “damage current relations.” Bradford Perkins defended this decision,
                        agreeing that “this type of information had been legitimately withheld.”
                        Kimball, too, accepted the validity of continued secrecy for these Japan
                        documents. The Committee, however, criticized virtually all of the excisions
                        and denials proposed for the Italy, 1955–1957 and the Indonesia, 1958–1960
                            compilations.<note place="foot" n="74" xml:id="chapter-11fn74">Tait

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1083"/>After the meeting, the HAC moved to address the
                        NSC’s concerns about the pending <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> legislation. On
                        July 9, Kimball met with NSC Deputy Legal Adviser Stephen Rademaker to
                        discuss the NSC’s three constitutional concerns. First, the provisions
                        guaranteeing HAC access to “any documentation it may wish to see” flouted
                        Presidential authority over national security and the Secretary of State’s
                        ability to conduct foreign relations. Second, the reporting requirements in
                        the draft legislation “obliged” the Secretary of State and other agency
                        directors to “take various steps” without regard for their (or the
                        President’s) discretion. Finally, Rademaker rejected the proposed
                        legislation’s defined exemptions for systematic declassification as
                        “different from and at variance with standards established by the President
                        for all other declassification.” Agreeing that “a vetoed bill was something
                        that the administration” and the academic community “would prefer to avoid,”
                        Kimball and Rademaker devised a compromise to the access and reporting
                        requirements that recognized the discretion of the Secretary of State to
                        accept or reject the Committee’s requests, “provided the Secretary informed
                        the Committee in writing” why any of their requests were denied.<note

                        executive branch, the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute staked a potent
                        marker that the era of eroding transparency had ended. Even so, in
                        subsequent years, security-minded officials continued to rely upon competing
                        statutory, regulatory, and administrative authorities to moderate the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute’s promotion of openness. Even as the
                        Department embraced greater transparency, other U.S. Government agencies
                        retained—and used—substantial leverage to influence the contents of <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. Advocates of openness hailed the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute, but acknowledged that hard work still
                        lay ahead before the series could resume its traditional role as a leading
                        vehicle of responsible historical transparency for U.S. foreign and national
                        security policies. This prospect would ultimately prove even more daunting
                        that expected because maintaining “traditional” levels of comprehensiveness
                        required the series to incorporate entirely unprecedented types of
                        documentation, especially with regard to intelligence activities and covert

                        transparency during the 1980s, champions of openness scored a remarkable
                        victory with the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute’s mandate for the
                        series, the HAC, and systematic declassification. Within the Department of
                        State, the law’s edict for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> to provide a
                        “thorough, accurate, and reliable record” settled—decisively—debate over the
                        mission of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Even when
                        Department officials determined that critical documentation could not be
                        declassified for publication in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, no one disputed
                        the legislated standard. The statute’s provisions regarding the Advisory
                        Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation (HAC) also resolved the
                        “civil war in the Department” in favor of transparency advocates. The
                        Department never again challenged the HAC’s authority to provide advice
                        about maintaining the standard prescribed by Congress.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1217"/>Despite the hopes of the academic community and
                        Congress, however, the 1991 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute represented
                        only the beginning of a process to rebalance security and transparency. For
                        the next decade, HO, the HAC, the CIA, the NSC, and other agencies
                        negotiated how to interpret and apply the law. The ensuing intense
                        interagency discussions inspired bureaucratic restructuring and the creation
                        of a new High Level Panel (HLP) to resolve intelligence-related
                        declassification questions. By 2002, the intellectual and institutional
                        foundations of the present series had been recast in light of the 1991
                        statute.</p>
                    <p>HO and HAC efforts to implement the law, however, demonstrated that national
                        security concerns continued to shape the parameters of transparency.
                        Fulfilling the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute required significant
                        changes in institutional culture outside of the Department of State. The
                        Central Intelligence Agency played a decisive role in shaping the evolution
                        of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in the 1990s.
                        Expanded access to CIA records and the plain language of the statute did not
                        ensure that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> could document historically
                        significant covert operations. By the mid-1990s, the series ran squarely
                        into legal and policy contradictions that the Department’s retreat from
                        openness had obscured in the 1980s. Did the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        statute neutralize the legal responsibility of the Director of Central
                        Intelligence (DCI) to protect intelligence sources and methods? How could
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians exploit CIA records if full and
                        direct access remained impossible? Would covert operations or other
                        sensitive intelligence activities be acknowledged when HO and the HAC
                        determined that producing a “thorough, accurate, and reliable” record
                        required documenting them? Who in the U.S. Government possessed the
                        authority to acknowledge covert operations? And, when such matters were
                        acknowledged, could meaningful documentation be released? HO, the HAC, and
                        the CIA spent a frustrating decade negotiating and renegotiating those
                        questions.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1479"/>Openness advocates also grappled with the enduring
                        dilemma of balancing comprehensiveness and timeliness. Their efforts built
                        upon decades of experiments in consolidating coverage within volumes and
                        subseries, applying new technology to publish more documents, and expanding
                        editorial devices to provide researchers additional information about
                        archival sources. Just as previous efforts to accelerate the series had
                        failed, the late 1990s “Future of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>” initiative
                        proved unsuccessful in bringing the series into compliance with the 30-year
                        line. Especially when taking into account the Department’s limited
                        resources, finding the proper balance between comprehensiveness and
                        timeliness remained a vexing problem.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitlebold">Building a Culture of Openness?</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute encouraged the Department of State to
                        strengthen its institutional capacity to promote responsible historical
                        transparency in the first half of the 1990s. After the Department warned the
                        Advisory Committee in 1992 that meeting the statute’s systematic review
                        requirement “cannot be achieved until 2010,” the HAC noted that “the
                        assumptions underlying the declassification review process [were] unchanged”
                        despite the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute, and lamented that “a ‘we’
                        versus ‘they’ attitude persists in certain areas in the department over the
                        issue of declassification of the historical record.” The Committee prodded
                        the Department to embrace openness, “particularly in the light of the new

                        months, the Department responded by developing an action plan to streamline
                        records management and declassification review procedures. In 1993, the
                        Department restored to HO responsibility for coordinating interagency
                        declassification of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> documents. These reforms

                            it should be emphasized, denote the archival source of documents
                            selected for inclusion in the series rather than the agency that
                            originally produced the documents. HO compiled the Kennedy volumes in
                            the late 1980s and early 1990s; Johnson volumes in the 1990s, and
                            Nixon/Ford volumes in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Documents selected
                            from Department of State records constituted 64.7 percent of the Kennedy
                            subseries, 53.2 percent of the Johnson subseries, and 29.6 percent of
                            the Nixon/Ford subseries. Analogous figures for documents from
                            presidential libraries were 25.5, 38.5, and 59.1 percent; for documents
                            drawn from military records, 5.5, 4.0, and 2.4 percent; for documents
                            from the CIA, 1.7, 2.3, and 1.7 percent. Henry Kissinger’s papers at the
                            Library of Congress comprised 5.0 percent of the Nixon/Ford subseries.
                            These figures do not reflect HO’s use of the Nixon tapes since many of
                            the transcriptions of these conversations appeared in Editorial Notes,
                            which were excluded from the queries.</note><anchor xml:id="b_1172-end"

                        Department of State in moving toward greater openness in the 1990s. In April
                        1993, President Bill Clinton ordered a review of the classification and
                        declassification systems “to ensure that they are in line with the reality
                        of the current, rather than the past, threat potential.” This review
                        focused, in part, on accelerating declassification and reducing the “large
                        amounts of classified information that currently exist in Government
                        archives and other repositories.”<note place="foot" n="14"

                        The resulting executive order, issued two years later, recognized that
                        “dramatic changes . . . provide a greater opportunity to emphasize our
                        commitment to open Government.” Echoing the proposed automatic

                        undertake a systematic declassification review program. This had been
                        optional under the previous executive order. Executive Order 12958 also
                        provided for automatic declassification of 30-year-old records in 2000
                        unless they contained information in one of nine exempted categories.<note

                        The automatic declassification provision galvanized many agencies to improve
                        their systematic review procedures to avoid the unpleasant prospect of
                        releasing unreviewed records after the deadline passed.<note place="foot"

                        the mid-1990s, when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan led a commission that
                        examined “the culture of secrecy” that had arisen in the U.S. Government
                        during the Cold War. At the end of the Moynihan Commission’s two-year
                        investigation, it recommended replacing the executive order-centered regime
                        for classifying and declassifying national security information with a
                        statutory mandate for information security. The Commission also suggested
                        centralizing declassification activities in a national Declassification
                        Center, which would implement guidelines prepared by originating
                            agencies.<note place="foot" n="17" xml:id="chapter-12fn17">

                        Despite the Moynihan Commission’s report, Congress avoided the thicket of
                        constitutional debate that would have greeted any attempt to legislate
                        classification and declassification across the U.S. Government. Instead, it
                        passed the Public Interest Declassification Act in 2000. In language echoing
                        the nearly decade-old <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute, the law created a
                        public advisory board jointly appointed by the President and the majority
                        and minority leaders of both Houses of Congress “to promote the fullest

                        portended a new era of openness in the early 1990s. In February 1992, DCI
                        Robert Gates announced “a real shift on CIA’s part toward greater openness
                        and sense of public responsibility.” Although he emphasized his continuing
                        “statutory responsibility to protect our sources and methods,” Gates also
                        believed that the Agency had to “be accountable to the American people” as
                        it played “a critical role in supporting national security policymakers in a
                        complex and often dangerous world.” Gates announced that he had transferred
                        declassification review responsibilities to the Center for the Study of
                        Intelligence (CSI), “where there will be a bias toward declassification of
                        historical documents.” Any appeals of a CSI declassification decision would
                        go directly to the DCI for final resolution. He directed that CSI reviewers
                        prioritize releasing information concerning “events of particular interest
                        to historians from the late 1940s to the early 1960s,” such as “the 1954
                        Guatemalan coup, the Bay of Pigs, and the Cuban Missile Crisis.”<note

                        fueled expectations for greater openness when he testified before the House
                        Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that he had “directed review for
                        declassification of significant Cold War covert actions more than 30 years
                        old.” He acknowledged “activities in support of democracy in France and
                        Italy in the 1940s and 1950s; support to anti-Sukarno rebels in Indonesia in
                        1958; support to Tibetan guerrillas in the 1950s and early 1960s; operations
                        against North Korea during the Korean War; and, operations in Laos in the
                        1960s.” He also echoed promises made by Gates to “declassify records on the
                        Bay of Pigs operation, the coups against President Arbenz of Guatemala and
                        against Prime Minister Mossadeq in Iran, and operations in the Dominican
                        Republic and the Congo.” Alongside this pledge to release information about
                        these 11 covert operations, Woolsey reiterated his predecessor’s insistence
                        that the Agency would continue to protect sources and methods needed to
                        preserve national security.<note place="foot" n="23" xml:id="chapter-12fn23"

                        records raised vexing dilemmas for the Agency and the Department. Plans for

                        reflected the central role that academic criticism of the Iran volume (and,
                        retroactively, the Guatemala volume) played in inspiring the 1991 law. Both
                        HO and the HAC agreed that the series’s credibility required covering covert
                        operations that resulted from “major foreign policy decisions” or whose
                        effects embodied “significant diplomatic activity.” Even as HO grappled with
                        the difficulties of documenting sensitive intelligence activities in current
                        compilations, the HAC also urged Department historians to produce
                        retrospective volumes to bring <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>’s coverage of the
                        late 1940s and 1950s up to the statutory mandate. These plans, like the
                        access arrangements made in the early 1990s, reflected HO and HAC optimism
                        that the CIA’s openness initiatives and the official acknowledgement of
                        several Cold War covert operations opened the world of intelligence

                            >FRUS</hi>, however, required greater exertions than anyone in the
                        Department or the CIA anticipated in the early 1990s. Working-level
                        declassification reviewers in both the Department and the Agency lacked the
                        authority to acknowledge covert operations. Senior-level officials disagreed
                        about where that authority resided in the interagency declassification
                        system. Because Presidential authorization was required to initiate covert
                        actions, the NSC would have to approve acknowledgement and release decisions
                        before other agencies could move forward. Since the NSC reviewed <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilations at the end of the clearance
                        process, however, CIA reviewers lacked White House guidance when they made
                        their release decisions. Despite the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> statute and
                        Clinton’s new executive order, no procedure existed to declassify as-yet
                        unacknowledged operations.</p>

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1109"/>In 1995, Donilon worked with Nora Slatkin, the
                        Executive Director of the CIA, and Rand Beers, the head of the NSC
                        Intelligence Directorate, to formalize principles guiding treatment of
                        covert actions in <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. They agreed on the “general
                        presumption that volumes of [the series] will disclose for the historical
                        record major covert actions undertaken as a matter of U.S. foreign policy.”
                        To implement this principle, they formed the interagency panel that ruled on
                        the Kennedy-era Japan and British Guiana volumes. After Donilon left the
                        Department, the panel languished. By the summer of 1997, a growing backlog
                        of CIA clearances and mounting HAC impatience with the deadlock led
                        Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to invite DCI George Tenet and
                        National Security Adviser Sandy Berger to formalize the HLP. As originally
                        designed, the Panel consisted of the Assistant Secretary of State for Public
                        Affairs, a senior CIA official (the Executive Director or the General
                        Counsel of the Agency), and the intelligence staff director at the NSC.
                        These principal officers would meet periodically to consider HO-prepared
                        issue statements providing a summary description of covert actions proposed
                        for inclusion in specific volumes and to examine proposed declassification
                        guidelines for reviewing documentation for release. In fact, the HLP
                        representatives met face-to-face only twice. In all subsequent cases, HLP
                        decisions were instead coordinated at the staff level, with HO drafting
                        issue statements and guidelines, securing clearance within the Department,
                        negotiating an agreed position with the CIA, and then seeking final approval
                        from the NSC. This shift in practice limited the engagement of senior
                        officials to approving release guidance while leaving interpretation and
                        implementation to mid-level and working-level management officers. The HLP
                        institutionalized new capacities to acknowledge historical covert operations
                        and “other sensitive intelligence issues” in the U.S. declassification
                        system. When it came into operation in early 1998, HO, the HAC, and the CIA
                        all hoped that the HLP would resolve increasingly alarming delays in
                        declassifying and publishing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>.<note place="foot"

                        <anchor xml:id="b_1097"/>Acknowledgment of covert operations, however, did
                        not necessarily lead to the release of significant documentation. Although
                        the HLP approved the acknowledgement of all 12 of the issues that came onto
                        its agenda in 1998, the CIA’s clearance decisions were much more constrained
                        than HO and the HAC expected. The HLP allowed for the acknowledgement of
                        additional covert operations but did not moderate CIA reluctance to release
                        operational documentation. Instead, the Department and the Agency arrived at
                        an impasse exemplified by the Indonesia, 1958–1960 volume (published in
                        1994). The preface to that volume noted that the compilation represented the
                        first example of the inclusion of a covert operation in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, but it also explained that
                        details of U.S. support for Indonesian rebels could not be released.
                        Although the HLP approved specific declassification guidelines for later
                        volumes, the HAC complained that “the CIA ke[pt] coming up with reasons not
                        to release the information (amounts of money, liaison relationships,
                        activities in-country, etc.).” Despite high-level support for increased
                        transparency, CIA officials applied HLP guidelines so conservatively in 1998
                        and 1999 that they contributed little to HO’s ability to document historical
                        covert operations.<note place="foot" n="34" xml:id="chapter-12fn34">Quote

                        arguments made since the 1970s about the “transparency value” of

                        to document intelligence activities abroad, ran headlong into the most
                        sensitive areas of CIA concern. Even after Department of State officials
                        retreated from 1980s-era views concerning security and transparency,
                        advocates of secrecy elsewhere in the U.S. Government could still hobble <hi

                    <p><anchor xml:id="b_1110"/>By the end of the 1990s, a backlash against <hi

                        the Directorate of Operations. In 1998, DCI Tenet reorganized the CIA’s
                        declassification functions. New procedures deemphasized the role played by
                        Agency historians and enhanced the ability of the various directorate
                        Information Review Officers to oversee release decisions. Tenet emphasized
                        his responsibility to protect national security, citing “the limits imposed
                        upon me by law not to jeopardize intelligence sources and methods, impinge
                        on our liaison relationships with other countries, or interfere with our

                        <anchor xml:id="b_608"/>In early 2001, Richard Kinsman, a CIA
                        declassification reviewer and former DO officer, published an article in the
                        Agency’s in-house scholarly journal, <hi rend="italic">Studies in
                            Intelligence</hi>, warning that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> “confronted
                        [the CIA] with increasingly frequent and deadly serious assaults on DCI
                        authorities and responsibilities.” Although he accepted that “approved
                        covert actions in and of themselves constitute foreign policy decisions when
                        on the scale of the Bay of Pigs, Afghanistan, Iran, and so forth,” Kinsman
                        argued that “providing details of operational implementation is quite
                        another” matter. HO “aggravated” these fears by its “efforts to provide
                        ‘historically accurate’ documents, citing [the] CIA by name,” which
                        “constituted de facto admission of a CIA presence abroad, a direct
                        contradiction of current policy.” <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> methodology
                        endangered “official CIA nonpresence abroad,” which Kinsman judged
                        “crucially important to CIA’s ability to conduct its clandestine missions of
                        collection, liaison, and covert action.” With HO and the HAC rejecting CIA
                        claims that “historical accuracy can be satisfied by describing the ‘fact
                        of’ a given covert action . . . without specifics that threaten clandestine
                        operational relationships and methodology,” Kinsman feared that “CIA is in
                        danger of losing control of its own declassification process . . . to the
                        nongovernmental academic community.”<note place="foot" n="37"
                            xml:id="chapter-12fn37">Kinsman attributed “serious, cumulative, and
                            long-term deleterious effects on the Agency” to “specific citations by
                            name to CIA in the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>.” Such citations, he
                            argued, were misconceived since any time the Agency conducted
                            “significant diplomatic activity” in the form of a covert operation, it
                            was “acting in its capacity as executive agent for policy levels of the
                            U.S. Government.” By drawing attention to the CIA, <hi rend="italic"
                                >FRUS</hi> “increased [the] sensitivity and awareness of the dangers
                            inherent in a CIA presence. This normally translates into increased
                            counterintelligence and/or terrorist activity directed against the real
                            or imagined CIA presence, making [the Clandestine Service’s] job more
                            difficult and risky, and occasionally life-threatening.” Kinsman also
                            argued that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> alarmed “host country liaison
                            entities” and “agent recruitment targets,” who might grow increasingly
                            fearful that “their cooperation . . . is likely to appear some day in
                            the official written record of the U.S. Government.” N. Richard Kinsman,

                        Kinsman’s fears of the risks posed by including intelligence documents in

                            >FRUS</hi> deteriorated in the late 1990s, the Department of State and
                        the Agency tried to address the increasing friction. In 1997, Agency
                        officials suggested that HO detail a <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historian
                        to the CIA (with additional Agency clearances) to resolve lingering access
                        issues and help both sides understand the priorities and concerns of the
                        other. Although eventually implemented to mutual satisfaction, this proposal
                        for a “joint historian” added to interagency tensions in the short term
                        rather than ameliorating them.<note place="foot" n="38"

                        postponed in May to avoid contributing to “recent political turmoil in
                        Indonesia.” The volume included documentation on the U.S. role in
                        identifying members of the Indonesian Community Party who were subsequently
                        targeted by “Indonesian security authorities” during the 1960s. After the

                            media coverage focused as much on the publication delay as on the
                            released documentation. He concluded that “it may the wisest course of
                            action to be as open as possible with the release of declassified,
                            archival material. In this case, doing so allowed us to map out the
                            limits of what U.S. involvement in Greece’s domestic affairs has been,
                            and to advertise, by example, the openness of American political
                            culture.” See Miller to Secretary of State (info to U.S. Consulate

                        HO and the CIA worked to find common ground and clarify their commitments
                        for promoting responsible historical transparency. At the end of an arduous
                        (but cathartic) negotiation process, the Department and the Agency agreed on
                        a refined framework for continued CIA cooperation in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> production process. In the process of forging a new MOU, both
                        sides clarified their own priorities and identified key concerns in a
                        “confidence-building” dialogue. The CIA strengthened its role in providing
                        HO advice about document selection, improved coordination for records
                        access, enhanced its equity-identification capabilities, refined security
                        safeguards, and expanded its authority over release decisions for some
                            volumes.<note place="foot" n="45" xml:id="chapter-12fn45">Minutes of

                            difficult to declassify.</note> The HAC insisted that new arrangements
                        must avoid “any additional layers of review,” retain the High Level Panel,
                        accept flexibility to reform the series, and preserve the Department’s
                        authority to make decisions about the timing of volume releases.<note

                        <anchor xml:id="b_9561"/>In the years following the passage of the statute,
                        both HO and the HAC deemphasized timeliness to focus on assuring the
                        series’s credibility as a full and comprehensive account of U.S. foreign
                        policy. Between 1991 and 1996 (the statute’s deadline for reaching the
                        30-year line), HO published 51 volumes and averaged a 32-year publication
                        line. From 1997 to 2002, the average lag stabilized, but production
                        plummeted to 28 volumes. This shortfall ensured that the publication lag
                        would grow in subsequent years. The impulse to sacrifice timeliness to
                        assure credibility first arose with regard to volumes prepared before the
                        1991 law that did not meet the new “thorough, accurate, and reliable”
                        standard. Both HO and the HAC supported delaying several volumes covering

                        From the early to mid-1990s, HO and the HAC resorted to the frequent use of
                        disclaimers to resolve tensions between timeliness and comprehensiveness. HO
                        included statements noting cases in which compilations were produced before

                        By the late 1990s, a combination of resource constraints, declassification
                        challenges, and the continuing expansion of the universe of foreign policy
                        documentation convinced Slany and Kimball that <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                        would have to evolve once again to meet the needs of its users and to
                        satisfy both aspects of its statutory mandate.<anchor xml:id="b_1575-end"

                        <anchor xml:id="b_594"/>In 1998, the “Future of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>”
                        initiative explored new paths to make documentation of U.S. foreign policy
                        more accessible. Some strategies echoed past expedients: HO staff and the
                        HAC discussed ways to tighten selection criteria. They also conceptualized
                        how individual volumes should fit into an overall scheme to satisfy the
                        “thorough and accurate” standard, conform to resource constraints, and meet
                        the 30-year deadline. Echoing Trask’s 1970s “three-tier” concept,
                        deliberations focused on what Kimball described as a “core, crisis, context”
                        framework. According to this schema, HO would engage in documentary triage,
                        with important “core” issues, themes, and diplomatic relationships receiving
                        complete and comprehensive treatment; foreign policy “crises” getting
                        intensive coverage; and broader regional (or global) “context” material
                        being handled much more selectively. Volumes covering U.S.–Soviet relations
                        exemplified this shift. Previously focusing on bilateral issues, compilers
                        would reframe these compilations as “Cold War” volumes reflecting the global
                        scope of Washington’s rivalry with Moscow. The HAC also urged HO to prepare
                        “framework” volumes illustrating the intellectual and organizational
                        foundations of U.S. decisionmaking. Finally, the “new” <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> series should deemphasize the existing organization of
                        subseries by Presidential administration, which had begun (coincidentally)
                        with the 1961–1963 triennium and (formally) with the Johnson subseries
                        conceived in 1990. Instead, the “Future of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>” plan
                        called for thematic volumes to present a more holistic account by including
                        documentation from multiple administrations when appropriate.<note

                        strategy, the “Future of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> plan” envisioned two
                        new publication mechanisms. First, electronic publication on the Internet
                        offered HO greater flexibility in releasing documentation. Not only would
                        Internet publication make the series more accessible, it also gave HO the
                        option to release partial compilations without abandoning declassification
                        appeals for printed volumes. Moreover, the Internet raised the possibility
                        of updating the minimally annotated microfiche supplements as
                        electronic-only “lite” volumes. Second, access guides could compensate for
                        the greater selectivity of the published documentation by providing
                        researchers with comprehensive road maps to relevant archival collections
                        enriched with experienced <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> historians’ subjective
                        judgments of their quality. The combination of printed volumes,
                        electronically-published collections, and access guides would provide HO a
                        wider array of tools to prosecute its core mission of making foreign policy
                        documentation available to the public and increasing the accessibility of
                        the wider, unpublished historical record.<note place="foot" n="56"

                        new vision for the series. Enthusiasm for electronic publication waned as
                        the editorial, technical, budgetary, and legal challenges involved became
                        clear. Internet supplements, like their microfiche forebears, taxed
                        declassification review capacities. Unlike the microfiche supplements,
                        however, they also required substantial editorial and publication resources
                        to comply with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with
                        Disabilities Act. Despite HAC enthusiasm for access guides, HO staff
                        expressed ambivalence over their marginal utility (and the increased
                        workload they required). The CIA feared access guides would, as the HAC
                        intended, significantly increase FOIA and mandatory declassification review
                        requests that the Agency lacked the resources to process. Owing to staff
                        attrition in the late 1990s (in part a manifestation of frictions generated
                        by conflicting imperatives in producing a timely and comprehensive series),
                        HO itself faced a daunting personnel shortage that the Department began
                        rectifying in 2001 and 2002. Despite HO efforts to experiment with the <hi

                        research” for multiple volumes simultaneously and reviving “team research”
                        at the Ford Presidential Library, the compilation process for each volume
                        still required the same 18–24 person-months that it had for decades. In
                        practice, many of the innovations proposed in the “Future of <hi

                        problems plaguing the series during the 1980s could be quickly resolved. <hi

                        could employ against transparency skeptics throughout the U.S. Government.
                        HAC members expected a flood of timely, comprehensive volumes. The

                        solved. The CIA and other intelligence agencies looked to preserve their
                        prerogatives for protecting sensitive information. Other federal agencies,
                        such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, assumed that
                        their <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> obligations would remain relatively minor.

                        incentive to compromise. Memory of congressional intervention and the

                <p>Throughout its history, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series has
                    embodied both the promise of open government and its constantly renegotiated
                    limits. Each <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume provides a snapshot of two kinds
                    of U.S. Government decisionmaking. The first is familiar to all <hi
                        rend="italic">FRUS</hi> readers, who turn to the series to examine
                    documentation of U.S. foreign policy. Early volumes contain valuable diplomatic
                    correspondence detailing instructions from Washington, exchanges with foreign
                    governments, and reports from diplomatic posts. Later volumes focus on
                    decisionmaking in Washington, usually at the White House. The evolving content
                    of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> reflects broader transformations long studied by
                    scholars: the expanding national security state, the centralization of authority
                    in the Presidency, and the specialization of functions within the
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Individual <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes also present a
                    snapshot of how stakeholders inside and outside of the U.S. Government
                    negotiated the boundaries of responsible transparency at a particular time. Each
                    step—compilation, editing, redaction, clearance, and publication—reflects
                    multiple institutional, domestic, and international contexts. The volumes
                    demonstrate how American officials drew the boundaries of responsible
                    transparency. This story includes the documents (often quite sensitive) that the
                    U.S. Government chose to publish, as well as information withheld. The selection
                    process for each volume reflected constraints in the kinds of records available
                    to Department compilers. Subsequent vetting by supervisory officers illustrated
                    the kinds of information judged both important and appropriate for the public to
                    know; the clearance process for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> required reviewers
                    to make inherently subjective decisions about the risks of release—and the
                    countervailing costs of non-release. An evolving framework of policies and
                    procedures guided such decisions to balance public accountability with important
                    national interests. One might imagine individual <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>
                    volumes as akin to tree rings: each iteration records the environmental
                    conditions from which it emerged; a broader story unfolds by examining change
                    over time.<anchor xml:id="b_1608-end" corresp="#b_1608-start"/></p>

                    <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> is valuable, therefore, not only for its content,
                    but also for the process it represents. At its creation, <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi> regularized the U.S. Government’s existing transparency regime,
                    which functioned as a manifestation of the constitutional separation of powers
                    between the executive and legislative branches of government. Until the second
                    decade of the 20th century, <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> and the
                    Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions remained the Department’s
                    principal means of informing Congress and the American people about the nation’s
                    diplomacy. In the early 20th century, the series adapted to unintended delays to
                    provide new utility to new audiences. Even as contemporaneous transparency norms
                    fell away, <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> remained an engine of openness by
                    publishing records of decisionmaking in addition to diplomatic exchanges. The
                    series also guided the operation of other elements of the increasingly
                    complicated historical transparency regime that emerged in the 20th century.
                    Researchers and the interested public increasingly monitored the
                    comprehensiveness and the timeliness of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> because
                    their access to records depended upon the clearance and publication of the
                    series. During the Cold War, amidst sweeping protections on the release of
                    foreign government information, intelligence sources and methods, and some
                    nuclear-related data, leading scholars blamed mounting government secrecy and
                    uneven declassification and release practices for the public’s distorted
                    understanding of recent history. After Congress intervened to provide a
                    statutory mandate for the series in 1991, openness advocates gained additional
                    leverage in their debates with officials inclined to maintain secrecy as they
                    continued negotiating the proper balance between security and transparency.
                    Throughout its long history, <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> has served
                    as the mechanism through which the U.S. Government determined how to deal with
                    many of its most sensitive records.<anchor xml:id="b_9657-end"

                    fulfills that role have changed, the values that the series embodies have
                    remained consistent and substantial. The U.S. Government has repeatedly cited
                        <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> as a manifestation of its commitment to
                    responsible transparency and democratic accountability. Presidents and
                    Secretaries of State have frequently identified domestic public support as a
                    resource vital to conducting an effective and sustainable foreign policy; they
                    have consistently relied upon the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series to inform Congress, scholars, domestic constituencies, and international
                    audiences about past U.S. policies. The continued presence of the series has
                    even swayed foreign governments to open their archives earlier and create their
                    own official documentary publications that emulate (on a much smaller scale) the

                    the extent that the series retains credibility in the eyes of its consumers. The

                    negative repercussions attributable to the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series
                    have not involved damaging releases of potentially-sensitive national security

                <p>This study demonstrates that current-day problems are not so different from those
                    of our forebears. They faced similar quandaries as they struggled to secure the
                    benefits of openness while protecting important security interests. That there
                    appears to be no permanent resolution to the dilemmas attendant to documenting
                    U.S. foreign policy should come as no surprise. Perhaps the most encouraging
                    observation arising from this work is that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations of the United States</hi> series exemplifies the importance that
                    U.S. citizens and their government place upon understanding America’s role in
                    the world. Neither the process nor the outcomes are perfect, but “the public
                    interest” would be much impoverished without such a mechanism for accountability
                    and self-examination.<anchor xml:id="b_1676-end" corresp="#b_1676-start"/></p>

                <p>We owe thanks to the many additional hands who made this work possible. Susan
                    Weetman and William Combes, in the Department of State’s Bureau of Information
                    Programs and Services, coordinated clearance of essential unreleased records.
                    Among our Office of the Historian colleagues, research assistant Dawn Whitehead
                    assembled a spreadsheet of documentary releases before the Civil War that
                    greatly aided analysis of the pre-<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> era. Forrest
                    Barnum assisted in conducting the research on the 1861 <hi rend="italic"
                        >FRUS</hi> volume. Evan Dawley generously conducted research in the Bernard
                    Noble and Bryton Barron Papers while on leave. Ambassador Edward Brynn, David
                    Herschler (both now retired), Stephen Randolph, Sara Berndt, Seth Center,
                    Elizabeth Charles, Melissa Jane Taylor, James Wilson, and former colleagues John
                    Collinge and Ted Keefer provided useful comments on significant portions of the
                    draft manuscript. In addition to commenting on the text, Joint Historian Michael
                    McCoyer facilitated Central Intelligence Agency clearance of documents essential
                    to support the last several chapters of the book. Joseph C. Wicentowski and
                    Joshua Botts exerted significant effort to render the finished manuscript into
                    multiple digital formats for maximum reader utility and to streamline the
                    printing process. Longtime <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> editor Rita Baker shared
                    helpful insights gleaned from her service in HO and copy-edited the final
                    manuscript.</p>
                <p>Historian-colleagues outside the office also provided invaluable assistance. In
                    2011, we benefited from the comments of discussants at a number of professional
                    meetings. The Society for History in the Federal Government provided an early
                    opportunity to share preliminary findings. Aaron W. Marrs presented a paper on
                    the inaugural <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume at the conference “Civil
                    War—Global Conflict” hosted by the College of Charleston, receiving helpful
                    suggestions and documents from Don Doyle, Niels Eichhorn, Amanda Foreman, and
                    Jay Sexton. The Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR)
                    meeting sponsored two sessions yielding useful insights from presenters Michael
                    Hogan, Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman, Richard Immerman, Howard Jones, J.C.A. Stagg,
                    and Sacha Zala. The University of Virginia Miller Center held a roundtable
                    discussion that provided very helpful input, especially from the organizer Brian
                    Balogh, and panelists Melvyn Leffler, Will Hitchcock, and Marc Selverstone. At
                    the 2013 SHAFR conference, Mary Dudziak, Robert Jervis, Melvyn Leffler, and
                    Robert McMahon provided a public review of the entire draft manuscript that gave
                    us several valuable suggestions for our final revisions.</p>
                <p>The dedicated staff at many archival sites also aided our work. Eisenhower
                    Presidential Library archivist Herb Pankratz helpfully assisted in securing
                    copies of material from the John Foster Dulles Papers. Tim Holtz, an archivist
                    at the Ford Presidential Library, also provided expeditious assistance. Lisa
                    Jones at the Reagan Library alerted us to records of NSC staff discussions about
                        <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. Prudence Doherty of the Special Collections
                    staff at the University of Vermont Library proved exceptionally helpful to
                    research conducted in the George Marsh Papers. The staff at the Library of
                    Congress Manuscript Division provided their usual helpful research guidance and
                    efficient delivery of material. Rod Ross offered expert guidance at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration’s Center for Legislative Archives.</p>
                <p>We wish to extend special acknowledgement to Archivist David A. Langbart of the
                    National Archives and Records Administration Textual Archives Services Division.
                    His encyclopedic knowledge of Department of State records proved immensely
                    valuable, he was always willing to discuss where else to look for documents, and
                    his diligent searching ferreted out records essential to making our story
                    comprehensible. In particular, he discovered crucial documentation about the
                    critical transition period for <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>, covering the first
                    decade of the 20th century through the 1940s, in miscellaneous, unindexed, and
                    other difficult-to-penetrate records. He also read the entire manuscript and
                    offered detailed comments and suggestions that measurably improved this book.
                    Mr. Langbart exemplifies the dedicated public servant-expert, without whom we

                <p>Finally, it is important to recognize our forebears. Today’s cadre of compilers,
                    reviewers, editors, and declassification coordinators owe a great debt to the
                    dedication of generations of Department officials and staff who, since the
                    1790s, have labored to realize the promise of <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>. We
                    hope this work honors their contributions to the continuing quest to provide the
                    American people a thorough, accurate, reliable, and instructive account of their
                    past.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong"><term>equity</term> or <term>equities</term>,</hi>
                        information originated by, classified by, or concerning the activities of
                        another government agency or organization that only they can declassify.
                        Records that contain other agency “equities” must be referred to those
                        agencies for declassification review before they can be released or
                        published. For example, a Department of State account of a meeting with a
                        CIA official would contain CIA equities and would have to be submitted to
                        the CIA for declassification review before it could be released by the
                        Department of State. Policies for recognizing foreign government equities
                        have evolved over time. In the 19th century, the U.S. Government freely
                        published formal correspondence with other governments without seeking their
                        consent. In the 20th century, the Department of State required foreign
                        government agreement before publishing foreign-origin documents, but not
                        when publishing American accounts of meetings with foreign officials. The
                        Department expanded its definition of foreign government information (FGI)
                        equities to include such U.S. memoranda of conversation in the 1970s and
                        implemented procedures to expand consultations with foreign governments to
                        clear documents for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series
                        after 1981. For additional information see the White House webpage regarding

                        especially in the 19th century. For clarity this book uses the short version
                        of the modern title throughout. <hi rend="italic">“Foreign Relations</hi>,”
                            “<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>,” “the series,” and “volumes” are employed
                        interchangeably to avoid excessive repetition of the same term. In the 19th
                        and early 20th centuries, the volumes typically included documents from
                        January through October of the year in question, with additional material
                        from November-December of the prior year that arrived too late for inclusion
                        in the publication. Throughout this work we cite the “principal year” of
                        publication in for simplification and clarity. For example, the official
                        title of what we refer to as the “1877 <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume,”
                        which included some documents from last few months of 1876, is <hi

                        The Department of State is gradually digitizing volumes moving backward in

                    <item><hi rend="strong">Grand conceptualization:</hi> At any given time,
                        Department officers overseeing <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> devise an
                        organizational scheme for the series as a whole. Compilers of individual
                        volumes (or portions thereof) fit their efforts to this holistic vision. The
                        basic 19th-century structure called for volume releases on an annual basis,
                        soon after the events chronicled, with the chapters organized by country. On
                        occasion, a “special edition” covered a specific topic of sufficient import
                        to warrant a dedicated volume. As the series grew in size and scope over the
                        20th century, the overarching arrangement changed to cover regions, or a
                        multi-year time period, or a key topic, or a Presidential administration.
                        Again, special cases like the 1919 peace negotiations and World War II
                        conference diplomacy merited separate subseries. </item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Volume conceptualization:</hi> Each complier (or team of
                        compilers) must determine the parameters of their individual volume. The
                        19th-century <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> grand conceptualization rendered
                        this a straightforward process. In the 20th century, as the volumes offered
                        more in-depth treatment of both policymaking and implementation, compilers
                        often consulted histories, memoirs, and other accounts to inform their
                        collection and selection strategies.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Collection:</hi> Compilers identify important records to
                        be consulted, search for them, and make copies or take notes of documents
                        likely to be selected for publication, or which provide background
                        information necessary to contextualize the volume. In the 19th and early
                        20th centuries, these researches only involved Department of State
                        files.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Selection:</hi> After gathering all relevant materials,
                        compilers choose a subset of the available record for publication. In the
                        19th century, compilers usually did not opt to reprint documents already
                        included in Supplemental <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> Submissions transmitted
                        to Congress (see <ref target="#chapter-4">chapter 4</ref> and <ref
                            target="#appendix-c">appendix C</ref>). As the 20th century progressed,
                        the number and size of files greatly increased. Consequently, the subset of
                        documents selected comprised a shrinking percentage of the total
                        record.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Annotation:</hi> As filing systems grew in complexity
                        over time, it became increasingly important to provide the provenance of
                        documents published. In recent decades, annotation has also included
                        significant amounts of information about persons, events, policies, other
                        documents referenced, and attachments. Since the 1960s, compilers have
                        relied on expanded annotation to mitigate the increasing selectivity of the
                        series.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Review:</hi> One or more Department officials, typically
                        of a higher level of authority than the compiler, review the manuscript for
                        completeness, cohesion, and concision. The review includes judgment of the
                        appropriateness of the content and the accuracy of annotations. In the 19th
                        century, this review might include the highest officers of the Department,
                        and the president as well. In recent decades, volumes typically go through a
                        two-stage review, with a front-line supervisor making recommendations for
                        amendment, followed by a second assessment from the series General Editor or
                        other senior manager in the Office of the Historian.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Clearance/Redaction/Declassification:</hi> All documents
                        selected by <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> compilers for publication undergo a
                        vetting process to ensure that sensitive or protected material is not
                        divulged. In some cases entire documents are withheld, while in other
                        instances only a part (and often a very small part) is excised. The
                        procedures have varied greatly over time. In the 19th century, Department
                        officers conducted this task at the same time they reviewed the manuscript.
                        In the 20th century, declassification specialists organized separately from
                        the compilation and review functions performed this task. From the 1920s
                        until 1980, Department desk officers reviewed documents related to their
                        operational responsibilities. After 1980, retired Senior Foreign Service
                        Officers took over clearance duties. Increasingly over time, this stage
                        involved securing clearance from other agencies when documents included
                        their equities. At times, permission has been sought from other governments
                        when foreign government information is included in documents selected for
                            <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> publication.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Editing:</hi> After the volume has been completed, the
                        text is edited for publication. This is a multi-stage process: first the
                        text is prepared for typesetting and then carefully reviewed to ensure that
                        all information about a document (classification, drafting, date, and so on)
                        is correctly rendered in the notes. Until the late 1970s, this typesetting
                        process preceded declassification review. Since then, compilations have been
                        cleared in manuscript before proceeding to typesetting. After the text is
                        typeset, the pages are compared to the original documents to make sure that
                        they have been faithfully copied by the typesetter. Any remaining textual
                        issues are flagged for consultation with the compiler. The front matter
                        (preface and lists of sources consulted, persons mentioned in the text, and
                        abbreviations used in the text) and an index are added to complete the text.
                        Once remaining editing issues are resolved with the typesetter, the volume
                        is then finished.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="strong">Publishing:</hi> The Department of State contracts with
                        the Government Printing Office to prepare and publish <hi rend="italic"

                        the printer in parts, and when the final segment was submitted, GPO would
                        bind the entire volume together. At times, lack of funding has delayed the
                        publication of fully-prepared volumes.</item>

                        this work as the “GPO Ledgers,” all part of NARA, RG 149: Registers of
                        Printing for Executive and Other Departments (1861–1887); Records of Orders
                        for printing (1877–1930); and Allotment Records (1887–1935). The GPO Ledgers
                        provide a substantial, but not complete, record of dates upon which the
                        Government Printing Office received orders to prepare <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> manuscripts for publication, completed printing the number of
                        copies ordered for a particular <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume, and
                        performed other <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>-related tasks like binding and
                        wrapping of unbound volumes into packages for delivery. It is not possible;
                        however, to assume that the figures in the GPO Ledgers provide the exact
                        production dates or precise number of copies printed for any given volume,
                        for several reasons. First, information does not exist for all volumes.
                        Second, the “order received” dates did not necessarily signal that the State
                        Department had completed compilation and redaction of an entire volume;
                        often the Department sent a portion of a volume to the printers, thereby
                        “opening” the order so GPO could begin work, and then the Department
                        submitted additional sections subsequently. Third, the “completion date” did
                        not necessarily conform to the official publication date; in some instances
                        the GPO received printing funds before the volumes were ready to publish,
                        and in many cases Department and congress each paid for their copies at
                        different times as funds became available. Finally, the “number ordered” for
                        any individual entry did not necessarily correspond with the number of
                        volumes printed for any given year. The GPO Ledgers contain a substantially
                        complete accounting of Department of State orders, but records of orders for
                        the House or Senate is much less comprehensive. Moreover, both the
                        Department and congress sometimes ordered more or fewer volumes than the
                        number prescribed in the laws of 1864, 1866, and 1895 cited below.
                        Nevertheless, by comparing the figures in the GPO Ledgers with the other
                        sources listed above, and with a few of the narrative archival documents
                        cited elsewhere in this work and newspaper accounts announcing the release
                        of many <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes, it is possible to build up a
