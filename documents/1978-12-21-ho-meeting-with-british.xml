                <p>Mr. Muir stated that he had learned from the Iran Desk that the Department was
                    currently reviewing papers dealing with Iran for the period 1952-1954 for
                    publication in the series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</hi>. He noted that the U.S. and U.K. Governments had worked closely
                    with respect to Iran during that period, and that it now was a matter of concern
                    because developments during that period related to the current situation in
                    Iran. Mr. Muir then raised two specific points. First, could the U.S. give the
                    U.K. an assurance that it will remove from these papers any specifically British
                    documents? Secondly, the U.K. hoped that the U.S. would raise with it the
                    question of what was included and what was edited out. Papers of U.S. origin
                    might contain information concerning British views, and the U.K. hoped it would
                    be possible to arrange a joint approach with a view to taking out embarrassing
                    papers.</p>
                <p>With respect to the first point, Mr. Glennon replied that the texts of all
                    British documents, or direct quotations therefrom, would be sent to the U.K. for
                    clearance. With respect to the second point, he noted that there was no
                    precedent for the U.S. to consult with any foreign government concerning the
                    publication of documents other than those originated by that government. The
                    U.K. did not refer its own documents to the U.S. prior to publication. It was
                    ultimately a question of sovereignty. The Department’s longstanding practice was
                    to notify a government that the U.S. was working on a volume covering a
                    particular subject at the time the documents were presented for clearance, and
                    once again about ten days before public release of the volume.</p>
                <p>Mr. Glennon and Mr. Claussen described the procedure by which the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series was edited and cleared, and
                    emphasized that there was no likelihood that material on Iran would be published
                    in the near future. The volume was under review by the Iran Country Director,
                    and this process alone would probably take at least a year. With the addition of
                    another year for indexing and printing, the earliest possible release date would
                    be 1980.</p>
                <p>Mr. Muir expressed the view that Iran in 1952-1954 was one of the relatively few
                    situations around the world during those years that still had a direct bearing
                    on current developments. The U.K. might take the approach of asking for a delay
                    in publication of material on Iran for 1952-1954 if recent developments in Iran
                    continued to be sensitive, and he wondered whether there had ever in the past
                    been requests for delay in publication by foreign governments or by desks in the
                    Department of State. He cited the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volume on Israel for 1948 as a possible example of this. Mr. Glennon replied
                    that there had been no requests for delay by foreign governments, but that in
                    occasional cases, such as that of China for 1949, the Department did not publish
                    a volume until the complete record could be released. Mr. Claussen explained
                    that publication of the volume on Israel for 1948 had not been delayed for any
                    reasons of political sensitivity, but rather to allow time for the editors to
                    review and incorporate papers of President Truman that had long been tied up in
                    the Truman estate. Sensitive developments were buffered by being presented in
                    context in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> and neither the volume on
                    Israel for 1948 nor any other recent volume had attracted much notice in the
                    press. Unlike some individual requests for documents under the Freedom of
                    Information Act, <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes were not
                    regarded as “scoops” by reporters interested in sensational developments.</p>
                <p>Mr. Woolfley emphasized in conclusion that because U.S. and U.K. interests in
                    Iran were identical, U.K. interests would surely be covered by the U.S. review
                    process. Mr. Muir said that the information he had been given was very helpful
                    and he would report it to his government.</p>
