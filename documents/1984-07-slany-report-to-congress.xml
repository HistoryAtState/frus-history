                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Introduction</hi></p>
                <p>The Conference Report on the Authorization Act for the Department of State for FY
                    1984 and 1985 (PL 98-164) requires that The Historian of the Department submit a
                    report to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on
                    Foreign Affairs. The report is to explain the reasons for the delay in the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series and the
                    measures required to accelerate publication. The Historian is also asked to
                    report on what would be required to bring the series to a 25-year line.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series began in 1861 as the annual
                    report by the Secretary of State to Congress. In the 19th century cabinet
                    officers provided annual reports to Congress on the conduct of their offices. In
                    view of the unique responsibilities of the Secretary of State, the Congress
                    required that he only submit documents rather than a narrative report. For some
                    time these documentary reports were submitted on an occasional basis. In 1861
                    the Department of State began gathering a year’s diplomatic correspondence
                    together in a volume or volumes as the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of
                        the United States</hi>. The series ceased to be a report to Congress on the
                    year’s diplomatic correspondence at the time of the Spanish-American war. The
                    series thereafter increasingly became a report by the Department of State for
                    the public as a whole.</p>
                <p>The official record of American foreign policy presented in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is used both within the
                    government and by scholars, students, journalists, and the general public as a
                    research tool, a teaching aid, and a reference resource. The volumes in the
                    series are highly respected as an accurate, objective, authoritative record. A
                    survey undertaken by the Department of State in 1982 demonstrated that more than
                    90 percent of academic and scholarly respondents found the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series essential to their research and studies and
                    deserving of continued publication.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series has been steadily improved in
                    quality, comprehensiveness, and size over the past 50 years. Present and past
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have carried out
                    their responsibilities with pride and dedication. The government and the public
                    have been well and faithfully served. The Department of State has supported and
                    sustained improvements of the publication and had the general cooperation and
                    endorsement of other government agencies. The series, nevertheless, has fallen
                    ever further from currency. And despite the general and widespread scholarly
                    support for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, doubts have
                    begun to arise even among the academic advocates of the series that the more
                    recent volumes less successfully met rising expectations regarding their
                    completeness or their timeliness.</p>
                <p>The following report explores the principal reasons for the delays in the
                    publication of the official record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The report also outlines those steps required or
                    already being taken to reverse the trend toward ever greater delay. The report
                    analyzes the overwhelming obstacles in moving to publication 25 years after the
                    events. The report’s conclusion is that a 30-year line is a reasonable and
                    achievable goal for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, but a
                    wide range of conceptual and procedural modifications are required if such a
                    goal is to be achieved. Above all, a spirit of partnership with the academic
                    community and government policymakers is essential to continue preparation of an
                    authoritative and accurate published foreign affairs record.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">What Are the Reasons for the Delays in the
                        Publication of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Series</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, published continuously by
                    the Department of State since 1861, is now 30 or more years behind currency. It
                    has never been so far behind events. The sense of delay has been emphasized by
                    the dwindling number of published volumes -- only 15 in the past 5 years. There
                    is no single cause for this delay, nor can it be attributed to any recent single
                    event or policy. The effort by the Department of State to provide an up-to-date,
                    authoritative published record of American foreign policy was difficult in the
                    nineteenth century and has become far more so in the twentieth. A wide range of
                    compiling clearance, and publishing problems have been confronted by the
                    Department and its Historical Office over the years. The problems persist to the
                    present day, albeit in a more contemporary context. Few of the issues are really
                    new; most have been with us and our predecessors. There follows a report on the
                    major problems in the preparation and publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series, the efforts made over time to meet those
                    problems, and the steps being taken now and in the near future to face the
                    problems anew.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="underline">Comprehensiveness</hi></p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Problem</hi></p>
                <p>The Department and specifically its Office of the Historian continue to prepare
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in accordance with a charter
                    largely formulated in 1925. The charter calls for a comprehensive record based
                    upon Department of State records supplemented as appropriate with records from
                    other agencies. The meaning of “comprehensive” is no longer an absolute.
                    Uncertainty over the definition prevents the making of sound and consistent
                    decisions on all phases of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program.
                    Volumes are delayed because they are, for various reasons, not regarded as
                    complete or because they will be perceived as incomplete by academic users.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Background</hi></p>
                <p>Until 1925 the Department of State adhered to no formalized set of principles for
                    the selection of records for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. Although the volumes were, until 1898, fairly
                    complete records of the preceding year’s diplomatic correspondence, some
                    documents were omitted or summarized. Often these were quite important. The
                    practice of selection became more pervasive in the early twentieth century. The
                    modern era for the series began in 1925 with the appointment of a Department
                    Historical Adviser and the promulgation by Secretary of State Frank Kellogg of a
                    charter for the preparation of the modern <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series.</p>
                <p>The Kellogg order of March 25, 1925 defined the scope of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series, the basis for editing standards, and the
                    principles of clearance. It remains, to this day, with minor modifications, the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> charter.</p>
                <p>The Kellogg order was, in large measure, a codification of accumulated practices
                    for the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    series was envisaged as a record of foreign affairs “policies and decisions”
                    essentially based upon the files of the Department of State. The order firmly
                    insisted upon compiling principles of completeness, objectivity, and historical
                    integrity, but it also clearly authorized omissions from the published record in
                    order to avoid compromising current negotiations, to condense the record, to
                    preserve confidence reposed in the Department by foreign governments and
                    officia1s, to avoid needless offense to governments and individuals, and to
                    avoid personal opinion not subsequently adopted by the Department as policy.</p>
                <p>The Kellogg charter of 1925 has been the constant framework for preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, but the actual compiling
                    practices and the changing expectations of users have increasingly come into
                    conflict with the charter’s principles. For some time the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series paid special attention to matters of
                    international law, and the structure and format of the volumes reflected the
                    international lawyers’ conceptual view of foreign relations as a series of
                    discrete cases. Academic users of the series for the inter-war period sometimes
                    criticized volumes for narrowness of scope and failure to document broader
                    policy developments.</p>
                <p>In the post-World War II period the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series remained bound by the Kellogg charter, but the Historical Office moved
                    steadily toward an expanded interpretation of the 1925 guidelines. The State
                    Department was no longer the single source for the official published record,
                    and the focus of compiling shifted from international law cases to the wider
                    realm of international diplomacy.</p>
                <p>The postwar compiling of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes was
                    expanded over the earlier volumes in five categories. First, the range of
                    documents selected was more comprehensive and included major White House and
                    military records. A wider assortment of Department records was also used.
                    Second, the compilers sought far more systematically to include records showing
                    the evolution of policies. Third, many more foreign government documents and
                    information gained from foreign sources were included. Fourth, a much more
                    elaborate editing mechanism was developed, involving the identification of
                    drafters, comparison of texts, and a fuller identification of the details of
                    those documents excluded.</p>
                <p>The content of the series evolved in response to the fundamental change in the
                    role of the United States in world affairs and the greater complexity of
                    American foreign relations. The Historical Office editors emphasized political
                    reporting and military aspects of diplomacy while giving international law and
                    the negotiation of conventional treaties much less attention. An exclusively
                    bilateral approach to viewing American foreign policy gradually gave way to a
                    functional approach, a concern for multilateral diplomacy, and attention to the
                    politico-military, scientific, commercial, and intelligence aspects of foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>During the 1950s and 1960s the Historical Office made several radical departures
                    from previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> preparation practices and
                    registered the most valuable achievement in government records publication in
                    the postwar era. In response to Congressional requests and support, the Office
                    collected and published the full American records of the World War II heads of
                    government meetings. Working with the full cooperation of the Defense Department
                    and the Presidential libraries, the Historical Office prepared highly detailed,
                    day-to-day records of the wartime conferences. The scope was wider than ever
                    attempted in the history of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    Every available scrap of paper was published. The Department published the Yalta
                    volume in 1955, the twin Potsdam volumes in 1961, and the Tehran volume in 1961.
                    The effort to prepare such detailed volumes proved too difficult for the Office
                    to sustain over a short period of time. Preparation of five other volumes was
                    allowed to proceed more gradually and was not completed until 1972.</p>
                <p>The Historical Office was also directed to prepare a special China subseries
                    during the late 1950s. The volumes were to provide the full authoritative record
                    of American involvement in China in the 1940s up to the Communist takeover. A
                    large team of historians prepared these volumes on the basis of established
                    methodology, but on a vastly increased scale of inclusion. However, only a few
                    of the proposed ten volumes were published before the Department reached the
                    conclusion that the subject was too sensitive for early publication. The idea of
                    a China subseries was quietly abandoned, and the remaining volumes were released
                    gradually through the 1960s, and 1970s as part of the regular series.</p>
                <p>The wartime conference and the special China volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series provided the model for a far more thorough
                    and comprehensive compilation of foreign affairs records. The regular volumes of
                    the series gradually began to reflect this wider scope.</p>
                <p>The mid-1970s were another watershed in defining the scope and comprehensiveness
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program as the Historical Office
                    began compiling the Eisenhower-Dulles foreign affairs record. Although formally
                    working within the Kellogg mandate, the Office devised a new set of
                    methodologies and practices for compiling the published volumes: the editors
                    systematically used the records of other agencies; lower-level Department
                    records were explored to discover the roots of policy and alternative policy
                    lines; traditional diplomatic exchanges were largely excluded in favor of
                    policymaking papers and the records of internal deliberations; the military,
                    economic, and cultural components of American foreign policy received even
                    greater attention than before. The editors also sought to extend the series into
                    the most sensitive and controversial episodes of American intelligence
                    activities and political action in foreign countries.</p>
                <p>The changing scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in
                    recent years and its entry into the sensitive area of still current intelligence
                    activities of the U.S. Government has been one of the major basic causes for the
                    slowdown in the publication of the series. If one is to apply the absolutely
                    widest definition of the meaning of foreign affairs records, then an even larger
                    segment is either in other government agencies inaccessible to the official
                    State Department historians or undeclassifiable. There has been increasing
                    uncertainty within the Department and its Historical Office as to whether the
                    series was meeting an agreed level of comprehensiveness in the published <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> record. The escalating expectations of
                    the academic community for the widest possible publication record further
                    complicates this judgment. The result has been a growing imprecision of purpose
                    for the series that influences every step in the preparation of <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes from earliest planning to
                    publication.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Solution</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series requires a clear renewal of
                    its mandate that accurately reflects the reality of the foreign affairs scene
                    during the last 25 years. The Office of the Historian must work closely within
                    the Department and with leaders of the academic community in developing a new
                    Department regulation defining the scope and content of official records
                    intended for publication in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>The Department of State should also consult with the academic community regarding
                    the naming of an editorial board for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The board would represent the scholarly disciplines
                    and users most concerned with the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series. It would meet with the Office of the Historian leadership frequently to
                    discuss plans, procedures, and problems. It would meet from time to time with
                    the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs to report on its work and
                    the prospect of the program. The board would report annually to the Advisory
                    Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation.</p>
                <p>The Department of State must also consider naming special scholarly panels to
                    consult with the Office of the Historian regarding particular volumes of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The panels would review
                    manuscripts, discuss compiling strategies, evaluate documents, and/or discuss
                    planning of volumes. Wherever possible, the Department would bring distinguished
                    private historians to the Office of the Historian to carry out editing
                    assignments outside the realm of skills of the permanent Office staff.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="underline">The Expanding Foreign Affairs Records</hi></p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Problem</hi></p>
                <p>The record of American foreign affairs has grown astronomically over the past 40
                    years, and it continues to expand. The millions of pages of records sent,
                    received, and generated by the Department of State and other agencies has
                    reached a scale that makes it difficult for anyone or any group of professionals
                    even to read it all, much less make evaluations, editing decisions, and
                    selections. The sheer magnitude of handling all these pages in a traditional
                    scholarly manner causes increasing delays.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Background</hi></p>
                <p>The growth of the quantity of foreign affairs records is not accurately
                    documented. Experts agree that the number of pages of paper records has expanded
                    exponentially since the end of the 1940s. A conservative estimate of the number
                    of pages of State Department records for the Eisenhower era is over 35,000,000
                    pages. This do not include the pages of records in the White House, Department
                    of Defense, and other governmental agencies. In the 1960s telegraphic traffic to
                    the Department alone amounted to 4,000 pages daily and 1,500,000 annually.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> staff historians of the 1930s and
                    1940s, who rarely exceeded 10 in number, had difficulty reviewing, case by case
                    and country by country, the much smaller body of foreign affairs records of the
                    pre-World War II period. Despite their dedicated and persistent efforts, the
                    staff could not do their work swiftly enough to avoid falling from 10 years
                    behind currency in 1930 to more than 15 years from currency in 1945.</p>
                <p>Since World War II, the United States has expanded its diplomatic relations to
                    the scores of new, emerging nations. By 1983, the United States had embassies to
                    136 foreign governments, major diplomatic missions at the headquarters of a
                    score of major treaty organizations, and 258 overseas posts. There are now
                    hundreds of major foreign policy players throughout the world and a complex
                    array of political, economic, military, scientific, agricultural, and cultural
                    issues of vital importance to the United States. Attempting to sort out every
                    aspect of these foreign affairs issues in a careful and scholarly manner is
                    probably beyond the knowledge and skills of any reasonable size professional
                    historical staff. In recent decades, the Historical Office staff has met its
                    long-standing mission by becoming ever more selective in its preparation of the
                    official record for publication and has excluded significant issues from
                    consideration for the record.</p>
                <p>The expanding scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program in
                    the 1960s and 1970s absorbed an ever larger portion of the total resources of
                    the Historical Office. For several decades after 1945, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> staff and the policy studies staff more or less
                    shared equally the Office resources and priorities. In 1975 the Office
                    reorganized so as to concentrate 80 percent or more of Office staff on the
                    acceleration of the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes. In 1978 the Department’s Inspector General reviewed the Office programs
                    and recommended a still more complete commitment of Office resources to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program. For a few years, contract
                    historians were hired to augment the regular Office staff. By the late 1970s, 20
                    professional historians were engaged in the compiling process. The Department
                    matched the staff augmentation with steady increases in funds for the editing
                    and printing of volumes.</p>
                <p>The expansion of Department resources committed to the preparation of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in recent years has not, by and
                    of itself, permitted the series to cope with the enormous, expanding foreign
                    affairs record and accelerate the compiling and publication of a comprehensive
                    record. The Office of the Historian has produced a bigger and ever more thorough
                    record, but the hope of its being either complete or more timely has not been
                    realized. The attempt to review all or most of the available foreign affairs
                    documents has daunted a thoroughly professional staff and contributed to further
                    delays in meeting a 20-year compiling line or even a 25-year compiling line.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Solution</hi></p>
                <p>The review, selection, and compilation of the official authoritative record of
                    American foreign policy has become too great a task to be carried out in
                    accordance with the methodology and procedures that were appropriate in an
                    earlier period. No one person or group of persons, however skilled and
                    dedicated, can use the customary methods of reading, page by page, even all the
                    “most important” documents. The vast and growing record requires new procedures
                    and methodologies. The Office of the Historian is obliged, if it is not to be
                    overwhelmed by the available record, to find ways of being far more selective.
                    It must add to its professional staff of diplomatic historians certain
                    nontraditional historians who can apply quantitative methods to the records, as
                    well as international affairs experts, historians of science and technology, and
                    economists who can evaluate the growing quantity of multilateral, technological,
                    and economic and financial events that dominate the more recent foreign policy
                    scene. On the other hand, the traditional concerns of the diplomatic historians
                    -- the complexities of diplomacy and foreign relations -- must also be
                    consistently pursued and not abandoned in favor of too exclusive a concentration
                    on the Washington policymaking ferment. The adaptation of the staff to its new
                    responsibilities has begun, but it must be developed more rapidly and more
                    decisively.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="underline">Foreign Government Information</hi></p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Problem</hi></p>
                <p>An essential element of the official diplomatic record selected by the Office of
                    the Historian for inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series consists of documents originated by foreign governments -- diplomatic
                    notes, <hi rend="underline">aides-mémoire</hi>, communications of heads of
                    government. An even larger portion of the selected record consists of American
                    documents containing information obtained from foreign governments in
                    confidence. The Department of State must obtain the formal concurrence of
                    foreign governments for the publication of their documents in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The successful conduct of
                    contemporary foreign relations requires respect for information conveyed by
                    other governments and their representatives in confidence. Some foreign
                    governments are reluctant to grant such concurrences or are very slow in
                    responding to Department requests. No major foreign governments release their
                    official documents earlier than 30 years after the event; it may be 40 or 50
                    years or never. The processing of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes is sometimes delayed pending the receipt of such concurrences.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Background</hi></p>
                <p>The Department of State first began after World War I to seek the permission of
                    foreign governments for printing their documents in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series. The responsibility for identifying such
                    documents and initiating diplomatic correspondence to obtain the necessary
                    permissions to print was exercised by the Historical Office until 1980 when the
                    Department’s Classification/Declassification Center took over responsibility for
                    such clearances as part of the overall Department restructuring of
                    declassification procedures. The basis for seeking such permission to print was
                    found in international law. Until the 1970s, the obtaining of such permission
                    had been a generally routine matter. There were occasionally exceptions when
                    some foreign governments were either unwilling or indifferent to responding to
                    these requests, but the impact upon the series was minor.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s some governments became more concerned not only about the fast
                    publication of some of their official documents in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series but also about the inclusion in the volumes of
                    sensitive information given to U.S. officials in confidence. These governments
                    indicated that they expected the Department of State to provide their documents
                    and their information the same level of protection they would receive at home.
                    This concern was probably accentuated by what some governments consider as
                    unwarranted disclosure of their information to American requesters using the
                    Freedom of Information Act. The inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series of documents from the 1950s of persisting sensitivity
                    to some foreign governments also contributed to an atmosphere of reluctance or
                    delay on the part of some foreign ministries. Some governments have failed to
                    respond for several years to requests for permission to print documents. The
                    Department of State believes that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series cannot go forward without such permissions. The processing of some
                    volumes has been delayed, and others have been revised to exclude the foreign
                    document or information.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Solution</hi></p>
                <p>The inclusion of foreign government documents and information creates delays in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that ultimately are outside
                    the control of the U.S. Government. Several measures are available and should be
                    pursued. First, the Office of the Historian can be far more selective in its use
                    of foreign government information so that requests to other governments can be
                    limited to the most essential items. Second, the Department can continue its
                    efforts to persuade and assure foreign governments of U.S. commitment to
                    protecting the confidentiality of diplomatic exchanges. Third, the Department
                    and its missions abroad can urge foreign governments to give prompt and positive
                    responses to requests for approval for publication of documents in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Fourth, the standards for
                    assessing the sensitivity of foreign government information can be still further
                    perfected to exclude any information or documents not properly requiring
                    concurrence from abroad.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="underline">Other Agency Records</hi></p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Problem</hi></p>
                <p>The full record of the development of American foreign policy requires the
                    inclusion of documents and information from government agencies and departments
                    other than the Department of State. In particular the Office of the Historian
                    must have access to and permission to include documents from the White House,
                    the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Agency for International
                    Development, the Department of Commerce, and the Treasury Department. Access to
                    the records of these agencies is limited and sometimes impossible. The process
                    of acquiring copies of documents from these other agencies, and subsequently
                    declassifying those included in the proposed <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes, is time-consuming and leads to delays in the
                    production process -- delays usually of months and often of years.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Background</hi></p>
                <p>When Secretary of State Kellogg established the modern <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series in 1925, the authorizing regulation called for the
                    preparation of an official diplomatic record essentially derived from the files
                    of the Department of State, but required the inclusion of documents from other
                    agencies when necessary to complete the record. Indeed, until World War II, the
                    record of American foreign policy was almost exclusively the record of the
                    Department of State. With the proliferation during and after the war of agencies
                    concerned with foreign affairs, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    historians had to seek records from outside the Department. An increasing
                    proportion of foreign policy decisions involved the President, the National
                    Security Council, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the
                    Central Intelligence Agency, and other government agencies including the
                    Treasury Department, the Commerce Department, the Agriculture Department, the
                    Export-Import Bank, and various foreign aid agencies. Preparation of a
                    comprehensive record of major foreign policy exchanges and activities required
                    the review, evaluation, and reproduction of an ever larger body of records from
                    these other agencies.</p>
                <p>Such official access usually must occur at the Agency itself, sometimes at the
                    National Archives, and particularly at the Presidential libraries. Access to the
                    records retained by agencies is consistently difficult, although official access
                    agreements were worked out during the 1970s with the Department of Defense, the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the historical areas of the various military
                    services. The examination of other agency records at the National Archives and
                    the Archives-managed Presidential libraries is orderly and professional but
                    restricted by special access procedures required by the agencies, the need for
                    the agency to review copies of all documents requested by the State Department
                    historians, and the delays resulting from the resource and personnel limitations
                    experienced by all National Archives units since 1980. Some agencies will, of
                    course, provide no official access for State Department historians to agency
                    records. Some agencies, like the Central Intelligence Agency and the National
                    Security Council, require that documents involving their equity found in third
                    agency files or in the files of the National Archives be reviewed by the agency
                    before being released to State Department historians. An elaborate,
                    time-consuming, and frequently imperfect procedure has been evolved by the State
                    Department and other foreign policy agencies to permit access to, review, and
                    copying of key foreign affairs records. The process is based upon caution and
                    care for security and the proper handling of all records.</p>
                <p>The difficulties encountered by the Historical staff in working with other
                    agencies to prepare <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes has caused
                    two Presidents to encourage and call for closer working relationships. On
                    September 6, 1961, President Kennedy issued National Security Action Memorandum
                    No. 91 addressed to the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, and the
                    Administrator of the General Services Administration. Kennedy’s directive called
                    upon the heads of agencies concerned with the publication of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series to avoid undue delays in the
                    preparation of the volumes and to cooperate fully with the Department of State
                    in the preparation of the series. On March 8, 1972, President Nixon issued
                    directions which called upon the Secretary of State to speed up the publication
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series to 20 years from currency
                    and requested the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence,
                    and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to cooperate
                    fully with the Secretary of State in the most expeditious manner and to the
                    maximum extent consistent with the requirements of national security.</p>
                <p>The directives of Presidents Kennedy and Nixon and the efforts of the Department
                    of State and its Historical Office have had only short-term success in
                    maintaining an optimal relationship for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series with other government agencies. There has never been a
                    fully worked out interagency agreement, or priorities and procedures for
                    cooperation in the preparation of the official published foreign affairs record.
                    The absence of these priorities has added a serious delay to the series and
                    compromised its ability to serve as a comprehensive record for all the
                    government.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Solution</hi></p>
                <p>Twelve years have passed since the last Presidential directive endorsing the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series as the
                    vehicle of official disclosure of the American foreign affairs record. Steps can
                    be taken within the Executive Branch to formulate a comparable directive
                    addressed to the principal foreign affairs agencies so that some momentum can be
                    given to the program of compiling a complete <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. A new interagency procedure for regularized access
                    and disclosure of agency records in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series is also urgently needed. Such a system would rationalize and regulate the
                    current time-consuming, <hi rend="underline">ad hoc</hi> arrangements for
                    gaining access to other agency records, for making copies, and for downgrading
                    and declassifying information. Finally, the Office of the Historian for its part
                    must exercise restraint in its use of other agency records so that its requests
                    for access and copies do not overwhelm limited agency resources and thwart the
                    best intentioned efforts at cooperation.</p>

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Problem</hi></p>
                <p>The largest part of the foreign policy record selected by State Department
                    historians for inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series
                    is composed of classified documents. During the past 40 years, the government,
                    including the State Department, has developed an increasingly elaborate
                    declassification system capable of properly and fully protecting American
                    diplomatic secrets. This declassification system has not developed smoothly, but
                    by leaps forward in complexity and comprehensiveness, and has resulted in a
                    variety of delays and dilemmas for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    program.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Background</hi></p>
                <p rend="underline">Early Department Clearance Procedures</p>
                <p>The concern within the Department of State regarding the sensitivity of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> record goes back at least to the
                    beginning of the twentieth century. The volume for 1898 on the Spanish-American
                    War was delayed until 1901 and was carefully prepared by a high-ranking officer
                    of the Department, John Bassett Moore. It was the first publication delay in 40
                    years. In the years that followed, senior Department officers took steps to
                    assure that deletions or delays in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    program protected current policy discussions. Before 1930, the Department’s
                    Solicitor exercised a pre-eminent role in the increasingly elaborate process for
                    the sensitivity clearances of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>With the establishment of an Historical Adviser in 1925 and a major publication
                    program in 1930, responsibility for the clearance of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes fell to the Department’s political divisions. The
                    Historical Adviser established the precedent of appealing <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> clearance and publication problems to Under
                    Secretaries of State and occasionally to the Secretary of State. The White House
                    has occasionally delayed <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.
                    President Roosevelt, for example, objected to and postponed the publication of
                    some volumes of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference because he believed they
                    recorded in too great detail the private deliberations of Allied heads of
                    governments.</p>
                <p>The World War II heads of government conference volumes and the special China
                    volumes for the 1940s required intense security review. The issue of releasing
                    particular documents in the volumes was intensely debated within the Department,
                    with other agencies, and sometimes with other governments. The clearance process
                    caused delays of volumes and deletion of documents and parts of documents.</p>
                <p>The wartime conference volumes provided a model for a more careful, thorough
                    collection of documents and editing of texts. The regular volumes of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series began to reflect the newer, more
                    scholarly approach. The improved procedures evoked general endorsement in the
                    Department of State, but also some concerns. There emerged in the Department
                    leadership a growing awareness of the substantive sensitivity of the official
                    record and possible dangers in the detailed recording in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes of the discussions and exchanges involved in
                    policy formulation. Secretaries Dulles and Rusk became final arbiters of some of
                    these disputes. By the 1960s the clearance of volumes tended to be as lengthy a
                    process as the compiling of the record.</p>
                <p rend="underline">Basis and Procedures for Declassification</p>
                <p>Since World War II, a formal system for control and orderly disclosure of
                    classified information has been developed and elaborated. Based on the National
                    Security Act of 1947 and therefore keyed initially to the protection of
                    intelligence information, procedures and criteria have been stipulated in a
                    series of executive orders, beginning with President Truman’s in 1951 and
                    continuing through, most recently, Executive Order 12356 issued by President
                    Reagan in August 1982. In 1979, the newly created
                    Classification/Declassification Center (A/CDC) assumed responsibility for
                    declassification of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes from the
                    geographic and functional bureaus of the Department. Most of the other
                    Departments and Agencies involved in foreign affairs have formed similar
                    centralized systems for declassification review.</p>
                <p>Within A/CDC, systematic review is performed by retired senior Foreign Service
                    Officers who have special area expertise and who enjoy the confidence of the
                    geographic bureaus that declassification decisions will be properly made or, in
                    marginal cases, referred to them. Thus, bureau personnel no longer find the
                    document review responsibility competing for attention with, and frequently
                    losing out to, pressing operational problems. Reviewers in CDC read documents
                    selected for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series on a
                    line-by-line basis so that as much as possible of even sensitive documents is
                    released. A/CDC also processes necessary referrals to other U.S. agencies and to
                    foreign governments.</p>
                <p rend="underline">Relationship of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series to Scholars’ Access to Records</p>
                <p>After World War II the Department of State maintained a program of limited access
                    by scholars to the more recent classified portion of the agency records, while
                    periodically transferring older historical portions of the foreign affairs files
                    to the National Archives for accessioning and opening to the public. The
                    program, coordinated for the Department by the Office of The Historian, defined
                    that portion of the still classified record -- not yet transferred to the
                    National Archives, but reviewed by the Office of the Historian in connection
                    with the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series --
                    as open to limited research by qual1f1ed researchers. Research notes made by
                    users of the program were reviewed by the relevant Department bureaus.</p>
                <p>The system was inherently inequitable and susceptible to favoritism. The gradual
                    fall from currency of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also
                    increasingly inhibited its utility. The program for restricted access for
                    scholars was ended by the Department in 1975. After that time individuals could
                    have access to the Department records already transferred to the National
                    Archives, but could have no access to the records not yet accessioned. Specific
                    individual requests could, of course, be made for papers under the expanded
                    Freedom of Information Act. Also, scholars could initiate requests for
                    historical documents through the Presidential libraries for mandatory
                    declassification review of records held there, under provisions of the current
                    Executive Order.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Controversies Regarding
                    Declassification</hi></p>
                <p>The Department’s centralized classification/declassification program has
                    implemented the requirements and spirit of the Carter (Executive Order 12065)
                    and Reagan executive orders on information control. Systematic guidelines have
                    been developed for the Department’s historical records, Freedom of Information
                    Act requests are being met fairly and increasingly effectively, and foreign
                    governments have been reassured regarding the proper security protection of
                    their information. The scholarly community has not, however, been fully
                    satisfied with the declassification program, particularly as it has affected the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The start-up of the
                    Department’s declassification program in 1979 and the more fully systematized
                    programs of other foreign affairs agencies had an immediate short-term impact
                    upon the rate of publication of the series. The start-up difficulties appear now
                    to have been overcome, but the declassification process has become elaborate,
                    highly structured, and subject to delays unless all parties involved in the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes work
                    together closely and cooperatively. The Department’s declassification program,
                    however it may compare with past programs, is the ally and shield of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series and is the leader among the
                    agencies in encouraging and advocating the disclosure of the foreign affairs
                    record.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Re-Review of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> Volumes</hi></p>
                <p>Just as the Classification/Declassification Center came into being, a diplomatic
                    incident over the inadvertent printing of highly sensitive foreign government
                    information in a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume led to a
                    high-level Department of State decision that A/CDC should re-review some 20
                    volumes already in manuscript following evaluation for declassification under
                    the previous arrangements. Although the Office of the Historian and A/CDC
                    cooperated in accomplishing the re-review promptly within the Department, the
                    necessity for additional referrals added to the delay, and in some instances the
                    Office of the Historian chose to defer publication rather than accept the
                    excisions and denials which the re-review produced. The re-review therefore
                    caused some delay in fact, and the appearance of more. Although it is not a
                    problem that will recur in the future, some scholars have continued to consider
                    A/CDC an obstruction. In reality, its creation has facilitated the process of
                    Departmental review.</p>
                <p rend="underline">How Is The System Working</p>
                <p>The new centralized classification/declassification system within the Department
                    and in some other agencies has been far more comprehensive and thorough in its
                    systematic review of historical files and its clearance of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes than any previous clearance process. This
                    cautious and careful implementation accurately reflects government directives
                    and the mounting concerns of policy officers regarding the sensitivity of many
                    foreign policy issues. Its strictness, however, has been viewed by many in the
                    scholarly community as an excessive constraint upon declassification by
                    comparison with pre-1979 practices. There is a general feeling among users of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series that the Department and the
                    government as a whole are erring in the direction of excessive classification.
                    For their part, the officers responsible for the new declassification system
                    feel that there has been too little recognition of how a careful line-by-line
                    review permits the disclosure, with minimum excisions, of many documents that
                    might otherwise be withheld entirely.</p>
                <p>The Office of The Historian and the Classification/Declassification Center have
                    worked ever more closely in the last several years toward common goals: to
                    assure that only those records and information that require security protection
                    are withheld from the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes; to
                    develop a full, accurate <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> record; and to
                    maintain the confidence of Department policy officers and foreign affairs
                    officers in other agencies that sensitive national security will be properly
                    protected.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Declassification of Other Agency
                        Documents</hi></p>
                <p>An ever larger portion of the basic <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    record is derived from other agencies and from the documents and information of
                    other governments. All U.S. agencies and authorities are generally supportive
                    and sympathetic to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program, but the
                    process for identifying and clearing the documents and information is
                    increasingly complicated and time-consuming. Considerable resources in
                    government are expended in the review and declassification of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. The process is not swift, but it must be
                    faultless. The Department has worked carefully to fine tune the process and
                    mitigate delays. The large scale of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    program makes acceleration of declassification difficult if due caution is to be
                    observed. Furthermore, the Department of State declassification review must be
                    completed before documents are referred to other agencies for their review and
                    to other governments for concurrence. This sequential procedure unavoidably
                    makes for delay.</p>

                <p>As indicated above, the goal of the Department of State is to achieve and

                    lengthy process. It is a process added on to the already lengthy
                    declassification procedure. From the time a volume has at last been fully
                    declassified to the time it is finally printed, bound, and released for sale,
                    one year to 18 months routinely elapses. The scheduling of the precise date for
                    release of volumes has become problematic. It is difficult to tell academic and
                    other public users when volumes will be printed and released. The Department and
                    particularly its declassification program have been blamed for delays in the
                    release of volumes for which they have no responsibility. The delays in
                    publishing have added an additional factor of demoralization to all other stages
                    of the process. Those who are responsible for assigning priority to the
                    preparation and clearing of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes ask
                    themselves why they must act expeditiously when the Department cannot assure
                    prompt publication of a volume once it is fully prepared and cleared.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Background</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series has been printed and
                    published by the Government Printing Office (GPO) throughout its 120 years of
                    existence. The Government Printing Office has provided consistent support to the
                    Department as the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series has expanded
                    in complexity and size over the last 50 years. The changing circumstances of the
                    last 10 years, however, have severely tested the effectiveness of the publishing
                    program and the government’s ability to place the official diplomatic record in
                    the hands of the public in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
                <p>Changing printing technology has had a major impact upon the production and
                    publication of the volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series. In particular, the introduction in the late 1970s of computerized
                    typesetting and the total abandonment of linotype printing contributed to the
                    delay in the publication of more than 20 <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes. The changeover in typesetting procedures caught many
                    volumes in mid-stream. In 1983 the GPO announced it was completely computerizing
                    its printing and asked the State Department to withdraw its holdings of linotype
                    lead plates for nearly 20 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes in
                    preparation and convert them into a computerized medium. These volumes had
                    languished in the galley proof stage at the GPO for 5 or more years awaiting
                    final declassification. Expensive and time-consuming reprocessing of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> texts by computerized typesetting was
                    required. The Government Printing Office and the Department have worked closely
                    in attempting to devise a fully effective and economical procedure for
                    publishing <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes from manuscript to
                    printed books in the new technology. A fully effective system, however, eluded
                    the parties through 1983.</p>
                <p>Before the computerized typesetting procedures were fully introduced, the
                    Department and the Government Printing Office attempted without great success to
                    cope with the necessary backlog of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes. The Department of State and other agencies had always used classified
                    printed galley proof of compiled <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes in determining declassification decisions. Their convenience and
                    legibility made the clearance process far more efficient than reading copies of
                    the original documents. But the length of the declassification review process,
                    sometimes 3, 4, or more years, created a growing backlog of partially printed
                    volumes and undermined any predictable scheduling at the GPO. As the GPO phased
                    out the linotype operation in the late 1970s, the backlogged volumes in galley
                    proof were the victims of more unexpected and protracted handling delays. The
                    delays accounted for the failure of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes to be published promptly even after declassification was finally
                    achieved.</p>
                <p>The average final production phase of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    has gradually lengthened from less than a year before 1978 to nearly two years
                    in 1983, measured from the point at which a <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volume is fully declassified to the date it is published and
                    released to the press and the public. The process involves steps by both the
                    Department and the GPO. The handling of volumes is closely confined by the need
                    for continued security protection, even after declassification of documents in
                    the volume, because of the volatility of day-to-day foreign relations events and
                    the possibility of reversals of clearances of information included in <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes awaiting release. The
                    difficulty in resolving the processing delays within the GPO-Department
                    relationship has spurred the search for alternative printers in private
                    enterprise as an alternative to publication of the series by the Public
                    Printer.</p>
                <p>Even a more efficient GPO-State Department relationship may not be able to
                    overcome other difficulties and problems associated with the processing of <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes at the Government Printing
                    Office. These include the limited number of volumes printed (fewer than 5,000
                    copies per volume), the paucity of advertising of volumes, the inability of
                    purchasers to subscribe to the series, the short duration during which the
                    volumes remain in print (fewer than 5 years), and the high agency production
                    cost per volume.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Solution</hi></p>
                <p>The Department has begun a comprehensive program to modernize the publication of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series by careful application of
                    computerized typesetting and printing processes. The Office of the Historian and
                    the Publishing Services Division of the Department of State have worked closely
                    with the Government Printing Office since 1981 to develop a computer program to
                    print books using computerized printing processes, word processors, and magnetic
                    tapes. The program and process will work equally well with books text-edited in
                    the Office of the Historian, by commercial typesetters, or at the GPO. The first
                    volumes to be produced in the new technology were published in 1983. As others
                    follow, the speed of the publication process should increase while the cost to
                    the Department and to purchasers will be reduced significantly. The printing and
                    release of more volumes more rapidly will eliminate the backlog of volumes and
                    the image of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series as a
                    publication not deserving of high priority and speedy processing.</p>
                <p>If the Government Printing Office itself cannot develop the procedures and
                    maintain the facilities to assure an accelerated publishing program in the new
                    technology, the Department may seek from the Congress a waiver of the statutory
                    requirement that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be prepared
                    exclusively by the Public Printer. The prodigious nature of the publishing
                    program to allow the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series to catch up
                    to and maintain publication at a 30-year line will require care in maintaining
                    adequate publishing capacity. The Department will continue to assure that the
                    volumes of the series are promptly and fully distributed to the depository
                    libraries and to members of Congress. The Department must seek the flexibility
                    in printing that will permit a sustained and scheduled production of volumes. It
                    will also seek improved distribution techniques to overcome problems of volumes
                    being out-of-print prematurely, inadequately advertised, and unavailable by
                    subscription.</p>

                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Problem</hi></p>
                <p>The Historical Office has spurred the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series forward by expanding its scope and perfecting its methodological
                    complexity. Accelerations have been mandated and goals have been established to
                    bring the series closer to currency. Yet, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series is currently further behind currency than ever. The
                    American diplomatic record is of necessity less accessible to scholars than it
                    was at the end of World War II. Uncontrolled growth has become the overriding
                    problem of the published series. Its ever expanding size has leaped far beyond
                    the ability of historians to compile, editors to edit, archivists to process,
                    declassifiers to review, and printers to publish.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Background</hi></p>
                <p>More than 260 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes have been
                    published since the series began 123 years ago. More than 145 volumes have been
                    published since 1950. The sad irony is that all the efforts to accelerate the
                    publication of the series have failed, and the series has steadily fallen
                    further behind currency. The following table outlines the growth of the series
                    and its proximity to currency.</p>

                <p>The Department, often supported by the White House and Congress, has sought to
                    press the series closer to currency. In each case the exhortation, goals, and
                    additional resources have resulted in an improved series but an ever larger one
                    that frustrated hopes of closing the gap.</p>
                <p>The Department’s first Historical Adviser developed an acceleration plan in the
                    late 1920s when the series was more than 10 years behind currency. A special
                    World War I series and multiple volumes for the first war years were projected.
                    Some 27 volumes were to be prepared in 5 years. The ambitious plan was adopted
                    by the State Department, approved by the Budget Bureau, but Congress withheld
                    funding for several years until persuaded by the scholarly community, led by
                    Charles Evans Hughes, to authorize the program. The Department pressed forward
                    with the program through the Depression and World War II. By the end of the
                    1940s, the 27 volumes had expanded to 50 and the series was 15 years behind
                    currency.</p>
                <p>After World War II the staff of the Historical Office expanded, and the program
                    struggled to hold at a 15-year line. In order to meet the need for the official
                    record of more recent and periodically important foreign affairs events, the
                    Department launched two new special series. In response to Congressional
                    requests and support, the Historical Office began the urgent compilation of the
                    full records of the World War II heads of government meetings at Washington,
                    Casablanca, Quebec, Tehran, Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam. The Yalta volume was
                    released in 1955, two volumes on the Potsdam meetings in 1960, and the Tehran
                    conference volume in 1961. The remaining four volumes languished and were not
                    all published until 1972. Also during the 1950s, the Department directed the
                    Historical Office to prepare the full record of American involvement in China in
                    the 1940s leading to the establishment of the People’s Republic. Ten volumes of
                    the projected China subseries for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> were
                    hurriedly prepared by a special team. The sensitivity of the subject, however,
                    required the Department to delay publication. The last of the 10 volumes was
                    finally released in 1978.</p>
                <p>On March 6, 1961, President Kennedy issued a directive endorsing the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series and calling upon department,
                    agencies, and libraries to cooperate with the Department of State in publishing
                    the volumes with a minimum of delay. The President pointed to the 20-year delay
                    in the series as “unfortunate and undesirable” and called for a goal of
                    publishing the official record at 15 years after the events. The Kennedy
                    directive and White House support for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series helped overcome some problems and assure sustained
                    funding for the program, but the series fell further behind while growing ever

                <p>On March 8, 1972, President Nixon issued a directive to Secretary of State Rogers
                    requiring an accelerated publication program for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series to bring it to a 20-year line “without impairing the
                    quality or comprehensiveness of the series”. The goal was to be achieved in 3
                    years, and the series maintained at that level from then on. The Secretary of
                    Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Assistant to the
                    President for National Security Affairs were directed to cooperate with
                    Secretary Rogers to meet the objectives of the President’s directive. The
                    Presidential directive resulted in the augmentation of Historical Office
                    resources and some increased cooperation by other agencies, but the series
                    merely grew more comprehensive, more thoroughly edited, larger, and further
                    behind currency.</p>
                <p>The expanding scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program
                    absorbed an even larger portion of the total resources of the Historical Office.
                    For several decades after 1945 the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    staff and the policy studies staff had shared more or less equally the Office
                    resources and priorities. By 1976 the Office reorganized so as to concentrate 80
                    percent or more of Office staff on the acceleration of the preparation of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
                <p>Methodology was modernized, the staff augmented, acceleration exhorted, but the
                    numbers of volumes actually published tended to diminish. The Historical Office
                    began the first of some 24 volumes for the 1952-1954 triennium in 1974. Most
                    were completed in manuscript by 1977. Only six of these were published by 1983.
                    Another 27 separate volumes for 1955-1957 were begun in the late 1970s and were
                    largely compiled by 1981. Compilation of the first 18 volumes for 1958-1960 was
                    begun in the early 1980s.</p>
                <p>In 8 years (1974-1981) of intense, accelerated compiling of the foreign affairs
                    record, nearly 60 volumes were prepared. The compilation time had been barely
                    held at the 25-year line and the publication time had slipped to 30 years. The
                    prodigious compiling effort had been converted into only six published volumes
                    and a backlog of substantial proportions had accumulated. The techniques for
                    compiling the official record had completely outdistanced the means for
                    publishing a declassified record. The record was in fact more inaccessible to
                    the scholars and public than at any time since the end of World War II.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">The Solution</hi></p>
                <p>Sixty years of experience by the Office of the Historian and other concerned
                    elements of the Department of State demonstrate the futility of all efforts to
                    bring the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series closer to currency
                    unless and until careful, even severe, restraint can be exercised on the size of
                    the series. The Historical Office must observe that restraint without
                    compromising accepted standards of accuracy and comprehensiveness. The Historian
                    must work to assure that only the essential official record is prepared in the
                    most efficient and concise form consistent with longstanding responsibilities
                    for scholarship. The overall size of the series should be scaled down from the
                    high level of more than 35,000 printed pages prepared for the 1952-1954
                    triennium and again for the 1955-1957 triennium.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is giving particular attention to the use of
                    microform supplements to the printed volumes of the series to assure scholars,
                    students, and the public the widest possible access to a full authoritative
                    record of American foreign policy. Microform cannot be a substitute for a letter
                    press edition of the official record, but can be a means for providing
                    libraries, institutions, and individual users with that part of the growing
                    foreign affairs record that does not require presentation in print. Pilot
                    projects already in process may provide the basis for requesting additional
                    resources and expanding this element of the work.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">What Would Be Necessary to Publish <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> at a 25-Year Line</hi></p>
                <p>To bring the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> to a 25-year publication
                    line within 15 years would require a prodigious effort in compiling, editing,
                    declassification, and publication never before attempted or envisaged. The
                    Department of State would have to publish the remaining principal records of the
                    Eisenhower administration and the records of the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and
                    Ford administrations by the year 2000. If the Department and its Office of The
                    Historian were to prepare an official record of the scale prepared over the last
                    10 years, the program to reach the 25-year line for the year 2000 would require
                    the preparation of 165 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes in the
                    next 16 years. If the scale were somewhat constrained, the record could be
                    produced in 150 volumes or less.</p>
                <p>The compiling and editing of these 150 or more volumes over a period of 12 or
                    more years would require a larger staff of historians and research assistants,
                    an enlarged team of technical editors, and a support staff of clerks working on
                    a sustained, uninterrupted basis. This level of production was never previously
                    attained by the Office of the Historian. It is obviously not impossible, but to
                    sustain it over 12 or more years would require optimum management and
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>The declassification of 150 <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes over
                    a 15-year period would require a substantially expanded declassification
                    capacity in the Department of State and comparable expansions at the other
                    agencies asked to review the proposed manuscripts for declassification. But even
                    such an augmentation of staff by itself would bring about only a limited
                    acceleration to the declassification process. The current sensitivity of
                    documents and the state of U.S. relations with other countries will remain
                    unavoidable constraints. Resources alone cannot speed up the preparation of the
                    series. The only way this burden could be limited would be by careful restraint
                    on the number of other agency documents included in the volumes by the
                    historians and editors. The precise number of personnel required over the
                    15-year period would depend upon the scale of the volumes and the quantity of
                    other agency documents included, but it certainly would require a substantial
                    increase in State Department declassification costs. Substantial increases in
                    the declassification personnel in other agencies involved in the clearance of
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes would also be
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>The archival costs for an accelerated compiling program would also be great.
                    Department of State critical records were converted in 1974 to a computerized
                    machine-readable form -- the FAIS system. But pre-1974 records are all paper
                    files. Intensified use of these records by the Office of the Historian would
                    require additional Department records management personnel. The use of
                    Presidential files at Cambridge, Austin, Ann Arbor, and elsewhere would require
                    substantial increments of archivists from the National Archives which has
                    suffered painful budget contractions in recent years. An exact estimate of
                    archival costs for an accelerated program is difficult to assess, but a
                    substantial increase in archival personnel and document copying costs must be
                    presumed.</p>
                <p>The printing and binding of 150 volumes in 15 years would require a considerable,
                    sustained outlay of funds. The utilization of computerized printing and word
                    processing, already far advanced in the Office of the Historian, has reduced
                    costs from earlier linotype costs per volume. Nevertheless, the technical
                    complexity of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes would require
                    careful processing. A cost per volume of $100,000 must be considered as a
                    minimum figure. The total cost of the accelerated program would amount to more
                    than $15 million.</p>
                <p>A program to bring the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series to a
                    25-year publication line would require large additional resources for an
                    extended period of time, as well as agreement on the required scale and scope of
                    the accelerated series. Acquisition of these resources and agreements may not be
                    feasible. They may not even be desirable. The Department of State already has
                    under study a variety of programs and studies aimed at a more realizable and
                    ultimately more useful goal of maintaining the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series at a 30-year publication line. There are compell1ng

                <p>Maintaining a 30 year line itself will prove a prodigious undertaking. If and
                    when it is successful, those in government and in the public sector can assure
                    the utility of seeking to move forward closer to currency.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Working With the Academic Community</hi></p>
                <p>The government as well as the academic community and the public in general have
                    long demonstrated trust in the scholarship, objectivity, and accuracy of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Historical Office over the
                    years has sought to earn that trust by steadily raising the level of
                    professionalism of the volumes and soliciting the advice and verification of the
                    users. But the trust continues to be tested, particularly as the timeliness of
                    the series falls short of the expectations and needs of government and
                    non-government users. It is a challenge that demands a new urgency and new
                    solution.</p>
                <p>American diplomatic history was once a very specialized discipline practiced by a
                    handful of scholars. In the years following World War II, the study of American
                    foreign affairs expanded as rapidly as America became involved around the world.
                    In the pre-World War II period the traditional diplomatic historians were
                    largely satisfied with the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series and
                    the special arrangements for access to Department records for scholars.
                    Circumstances changed drastically, however, in the following 40 years. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series continued to be respected as an
                    important tool of foreign affairs research, but its incompleteness on some
                    sensitive topics may have limited its usefulness and even aroused fears
                    regarding its objectivity. Worse still, the growing body of new scholars
                    involved in the study of foreign affairs and international history often found
                    their research increasingly thwarted by delayed publication of the official
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series and the perceived
                    inadequacy of other means of access to official records. In recent years the
                    American scholarly community has resorted to various panels and committees to
                    give expression to its requirements and concerns regarding the foreign affairs
                    record.</p>
                <p>The involvement of the series in politicized topics such as the wartime
                    conferences and China, the impact of clearance deletions on the content of
                    published volumes, and the growing concern of the historical community over the
                    publication program, caused the Department to create a <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> Advisory Committee<note n="**" place="foot">The Advisory
                        Committee was renamed the Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                        Documentation in 1975.</note> in the late 1950s. The Advisory Committee,
                    composed of representatives of the major national historical, political science,
                    and international law societies, was to monitor the integrity of the work of the
                    Historical Office and to confirm to the academic community the objectivity and
                    accuracy of the published volumes. The Advisory Committee has met annually at
                    the Department of State since 1958 to review the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> program and its plans and problems.</p>
                <p>The Committee has carefully monitored the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> program, acknowledging the scholarship of the volumes. The
                    Committee has also consistently advised the Department to support adequately the
                    Historical Office to allow the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> program
                    to proceed and has deplored the program’s steady retreat from 20 years to more
                    than 30 years behind currency.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has, in recent years, become ever more concerned about the
                    details of the operations of the Department as they affect the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series, particularly the declassification program.
                    The Advisory Committee has also turned more of its attention to the question of
                    scholars’ access to the full foreign affairs record and the Department’s
                    policies in this area.</p>
                <p>Recently, representatives of the American Historical Association, the
                    Organization of American Historians, and the Society of American Archivists have
                    constituted a joint committee to investigate government programs of access and
                    disclosure. The Committee wrote the Secretary of State in December 1981 to
                    express concern about serious delays in declassifying documents for publication
                    in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>. On November 16, 1982, the Committee
                    again wrote the Secretary, noting the “timely and objective release and
                    publication of basic documents of American international relations is an
                    important element in our system of open and responsible government.” The
                    Committee has urged more resources and stronger support for the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in order to overcome the time
                    lag in publication which has slipped to 30 years.</p>
                <p>The professional organizations are now actively engaged in other ways of
                    promoting earlier disclosure of foreign affairs records. The American Historical
                    Association vigorously supports earlier declassification. The Annual Report of
                    its Research Division for 1982 contended that the present executive order on
                    classification, E.O. 12356 of April 1982, “dramatically reverses policies of
                    recent decades.” The report urged the establishment of a 20-year
                    declassification line. The Organization of American Historians has appointed an
                    access committee which includes the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series within its purview. Since 1976 the National Coordinating Committee for
                    the Promotion of History, representing most major historical organizations in
                    the United States, has worked in Washington on behalf of the National Archives
                    and for more rapid declassification. The Coalition to Save Our Documentary
                    Heritage is a more recent organization committed to the same objectives. The
                    Society for History in the Federal Government, founded in 1979 and now with a
                    membership of over 950, also has supported the acceleration of declassification
                    and the release of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>. The Society of
                    Historians of American Foreign Relations established a government relations
                    committee to monitor the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series and the opening of records at the National Archives.
                    The American Society for International Law, a consistent advocate and supporter
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> over the past decades, has
                    argued for its more timely publication and has passed several resolutions in
                    recent years urging the more rapid release of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
                <p rend="center"><hi rend="underline">Conclusion</hi></p>
                <p>The measures already undertaken and contemplated by the Department of State to
                    achieve publication of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series at
                    the 30-year line should be pursued with deliberation and full care for the
                    longstanding traditions of scholarship and objectivity of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Historian of the Department must have a
                    full role in the process leading to decisions affecting the preparation,
                    declassification, and publication of the volumes in the series. The Advisory
                    Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation should be consulted by the
                    Department at all stages in the development of an action program for the series.
                    The academic community should be asked to become more involved with foreign
                    affairs practitioners in the planning of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series and any special supplements being planned for the
                    1960s and 1970s. This involvement should be aimed at assuring that the design,
                    preparation, clearance, and publication of each <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volume for future years meets the basic criteria for an
                    authoritative, comprehensive, and objective volume. The high cost of preparing
                    the series requires that it respond fully and precisely to historical
                    requirements for a permanent record. It must address all major foreign affairs
                    issues, depict the evolution of policies, and present a fully balanced picture
                    of issues and possibilities in the diplomatic field. It must fully support the
                    Department’s commitment to disclosing the official record to the public as soon
                    as possible. The Department policy offices and declassification directors must
                    also be made closer partners in the preparation and publication of the series
                    and come to a fuller awareness of their responsibility for the success of the
                    program.</p>
                <p>All efforts with the public and within government must aim at the following three
                    cardinal undertakings:</p>
                <p>First, The Historian must exercise intense restraint upon the size of the record
                    selected and compiled and upon the scale of documentation sought from other
                    government agencies. The Historian cannot successfully accomplish this goal in
                    the face of demands from within government and the public for expanded volumes.
                    The prospective size and scope of the series must have full support from within
                    government and from academic and scholarly users.</p>
                <p>Second, criteria of completeness and comprehensiveness of the official foreign
                    affairs record which have been debated over recent years must be defined. The
                    current definition of comprehensiveness has not satisfied academic users of the
                    series who find the expanded series still not sufficiently complete. Without an
                    agreement on the scope of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    any program for publication will, however expensive, be hopelessly burdened with
                    controversy~</p>
                <p>Third, drawing closer to currency will necessarily result in a larger proportion
                    of documents denied declassification on national security grounds or because of
                    current sensitivity. The release of more foreign government documents will be
                    denied concurrence and much more foreign government information will be denied.
                    These circumstances conflict with the standards of completeness and with the
                    sentiment of a majority of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> users who,
                    in a Department survey in 1982, expressed a preference for a more comprehensive
                    series, even if published later, than for more selective volumes. The greater
                    selectivity of the series would have to be clearly explained, understood, and
                    acknowledged within government and the academic community.</p>
