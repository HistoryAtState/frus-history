                <p>Chairman Kimball convened the meeting at 9:10 a.m. He asked the Committee members
                    if they had any additions or corrections to the minutes of the last meeting.
                    Hearing none, he determined that the minutes stand.</p>
                <p>Kimball noted that the agenda called for remarks by the PA leadership, but
                    Richard Boucher, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, has
                    left to travel with the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary-designate, Thomas E.
                    Donilon, has not yet been confirmed.</p>
                <p>William Slany informed the Committee that Acting Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration Jerome Tolson would meet with the Committee in the afternoon in
                    lieu of Joe Chaddic to discuss the issue of the transfer of Department of State
                    records to the National Archives. He will also join them after lunch for coffee.
                    Kimball added that Trudy Peterson of NARA would be present for the afternoon
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>Betty Glad asked if the agenda included discussion of the handling of
                    Presidential papers. Kimball confirmed that it was a concern, and John Fawcett
                    of NARA would be coming to discuss archival matters. Ken Rossman of the
                    Department Records Management Staff would speak about the recent court decision
                    on electronic records.</p>
                <p>Kimball then called on Slany to make his report as Historian. Slany began by
                    saying that he had no written report, but was pleased to announce that the <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> series is on schedule to reach the
                    30-year line by 1996 but the Department may not be in complete compliance until
                    1997. Most of the volumes documenting the Johnson administration (through 1968)
                    will be compiled by 1995 but will not be fully published until 1997. Compilation
                    of the Nixon volumes will begin in 1995 and 1996. He showed the Committee a bar
                    graph identifying the PA/HO <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> annual
                    publication plan through 1999. <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Declassification
                        issues<hi rend="italic">]</hi>, <note n="*" xml:id="p3fn1">HDR requests the
                        bracketed portion be changed to: “The ability of other agencies to meet the
                        120-day declassification deadline…”.</note> he asserted, will be the major
                    problem in meeting the schedule.</p>
                <p>The problem in the State Department is to declassify and publish approximately 35
                    volumes compiled in the 1980s, which do not reflect all the requirements of the
                    legislation but do conform to the intent of the law. The accessibility of
                    materials for the volumes is broader now than before, but the Office decided it
                    was not necessary to re-compile these volumes in order to maintain
                    accountability.</p>
                <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0004"/>
                <p>Kimball asked if there were any questions about specific volumes. George Herring
                    asked about the 1958-1960 Japan-Indonesia volume that a subcommittee had
                    reviewed at the last meeting. Slany informed him that the decision was made not
                    to publish the Japan compilation separately because it was too small. The
                    Indonesia compilation is still at the CIA, where documents identified by the
                    subcommittee are being reviewed by John Pereira’s Historical Review Group, and
                    Jeanne Pryor added that Indonesia documents are still at NSC. Herring, Kimball,
                    and Perkins all indicated their belief that the CIA should be asked about the
                    volume’s status, possibly at the lunch scheduled for the next day.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked about the 1958-1960 National Security volume. Pryor reported on the
                    progress: Department of Energy has returned about 220 documents; 12 documents
                    are at the Department of Justice (at the moment, Justice has no declassification
                    authority); and the Department of Defense has not yet responded to HDR’s
                    reclama.</p>
                <p>Rosenberg returned to the issue of the volumes compiled more than a decade ago,
                    before the legislation; are there any gaps in coverage? Slany answered that he
                    was not aware of any gaps and the preface includes the date of compilation of
                    volumes that predates the legislation. In terms of intelligence documents, the
                    Office has an arrangement with Ken McDonald of CIA that historians can request
                    access to material for already-compiled volumes if necessary.</p>
                <p>Glenn LaFantasie noted that some compilers have gotten some CIA documents for the
                    1958-1960 volumes and they have been included in the microfiche supplements.</p>
                <p>Rosenberg asked if the preface indicated if intelligence material was excluded.
                    Slany answered that the preface notes the extent to which intelligence documents
                    were sought.</p>
                <p>Rosenberg then asked if language explaining the duties of the Committee was
                    included in the prefaces; Slany replied that they did not. Kimball decided that
                    he wants to consider adding language to the prefaces about the Committee’s role.
                    LaFantasie noted that the prefaces are by no means standard and address specific
                    issues for each volume.</p>
                <p>Betty Glad asked about the 1961-1963 Cuba volume and if transcripts of meetings
                    other than the two recorded EXCOM meetings released by the JFK Library were
                    included? One of the compilers, Ted Keefer, said that the written records of
                    some of the presidential meetings have been included but that he has not seen or
                    heard the tapes. To his knowledge, the remaining tapes have not been
                    transcribed. Nelson commented on the difficulty of transcribing tapes of
                    meetings. Glad agreed with Nelson that this was a potential problem. Keefer
                    indicated the volume would be published without the transcripts; Glad said that
                    should be included in the preface.</p>
                <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0005"/>
                <p>Kimball asked Slany if there were any specific volumes falling behind in the
                    schedule. Slany noted that the Department of State declassification is being
                    completed within the legislated mandate but not that of the other agencies. He
                    noted the plan to move the function of coordinating the declassification of <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes to PA/HO in order to focus
                    on the 120-day deadline and solve some of the delays. Declassification would
                    take place simultaneously in the Department and other agencies; the NSC,
                    however, insists on being last. Foreign government clearance is another problem.
                    The reorganization will help with management of documents, but presents a large
                    recordkeeping and security problem.</p>
                <p>Nelson asked about possible staff cuts at the NSC. <hi rend="italic"
                    >[</hi>Chaddic said he had heard there would be no increase<hi rend="italic"
                        >]</hi>; <note n="*" xml:id="p5fn2">HDR requests that the bracket portion be
                        changed to: “Jeanne Pryor said the office that handles declassification
                        review was not expecting additional resources.”</note> David Langbart of
                    NARA said there will be cuts. Pryor pointed that three people at NSC do all the
                    declassification: FOIA, <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>, and
                    congressional requests. Slany noted that the NSC often has priorities that take
                    precedence over <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>, and that HDR staff
                    already helps NSC prepare much of its paperwork.</p>
                <p>Herring and Perkins both commented on the upcoming problems in compiling the
                    volumes for the Nixon administration. Slany agreed that the government must
                    focus on the organization of papers. Kimball said the Committee could discuss
                    this with the NARA representatives.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie noted that research and compilation of the volumes were on schedule.
                    Some target dates had been changed for editorial reasons but all deadlines were
                    being enforced.</p>
                <p>Slany said that in some instances the initial target dates on the Perkins chart
                    have not been met, but the chart is an effective control mechanism. He hopes to
                    create a database that will present the information more clearly. Kimball and
                    the other members jumped in and said that they find the chart very useful.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie asked the members to make one correction to the chart: the 1961-1963
                    Africa volume was compiled by its target date of 12/92.</p>
                <p>Slany continued his report: the staff is engaged in research for compiling the
                    Kennedy and Johnson volumes. He stated that PA/HO needs access to the
                    Presidential recordings to know if the volumes are complete. Access to
                    documentation is generally but slowly expanding and the historians are beginning
                    to incorporate a broader range of materials in volumes. The content, style, and
                    format of the Johnson volumes is being determined.</p>
                <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0006"/>
                <p>The budget for fiscal year 1993 is more than adequate and the budget for 1994
                    looks adequate for what is planned to be compiled and published. He does not
                    want to ask for more money until he can determine a real need. He does not
                    anticipate that staff departures will impact on the schedule; contractors and
                    consultants remain an option.</p>
                <p>Herring asked about the length of training for new historians. Slany answered
                    that it depends on their experience with documents. LaFantasie added that there
                    is a training period, but that the applicants have been well-qualified. He noted
                    that hiring entry-level people may impact on the schedule, but recent experience
                    showed that well-qualified entry-level compilers learn quickly and require only
                    a short training period. Glad asked about a hiring freeze and Slany indicated
                    that although it was a possibility there had been no indication of a hiring
                    freeze.</p>
                <p>Slany underscored the importance of the Committee’s written report. He is working
                    on disseminating the report outside government to the scholarly associations’
                    newsletters. Kimball asked if he had received any acknowledgment from the
                    Secretary or his office of having received it. Slany said he had not. Kimball
                    commented that he thought the Committee should receive such an
                    acknowledgment.</p>
                <p>Glad asked if requests for the report were answered. Slany answered that it was
                    given to the press (Jack Anderson); to foreign ministries interested in the
                    Committee’s work (U.K., French, Canadian), who inquired about meeting scheduled
                    releases as a precedent for themselves; to foreign governments; and to other
                    U.S. agencies in Washington.</p>
                <p>Slany noted that he has not solved the problem of disseminating the letter of
                    November 25, 1992, and the report of January 5, 1993, from Kimball for
                    forwarding to Congressional committees. After some discussion, Kimball
                    instructed Slany to solve this problem now.</p>
                <p>Ann Van Camp asked if the Office had investigated other technologies in terms of
                    publishing the series. LaFantasie spoke about CD-ROM and a pilot project for the
                    Kennedy volumes that will enhance dissemination of the series. The project is
                    being conducted in concert with another PA office. Slany said the goal was to
                    put all Kennedy volumes on CD by 1995. This project would be a supplement to,
                    not a substitute for, the printed books.</p>
                <p>Van Camp also raised the possibility of imaging on CD-ROM, but LaFantasie pointed
                    out full-text searches would be impossible.</p>
                <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0007"/>
                <p>After general comments about search software, Kimball said the Committee should
                    set a target date to discuss planning for the Nixon volumes and include CD-ROM
                    as part of this discussion.</p>
                <p>The session adjourned at 10:31 a.m.</p>
            </div>

                <p>Slany stated that the Committee would be joined at the end of lunch by Acting
                    Assistant Secretary for Administration Jerome Tolson and Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Administration Warren Littrel, who is in charge of Information
                    Management.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked if PA/HO had an access agreement with DOD yet. Upon learning that
                    the answer was no, he proposed to write a letter to the Secretary of State
                    inquiring about this. The Committee agreed that this was a good idea but that no
                    approach should be made at this time concerning NSA. Kimball asked if DOD was
                    cooperative. Slany replied that they were cooperating except that they had been
                    unwilling to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, which did not affect the PA/HO
                    access to DOD documentation, but might affect the Committee’s access.</p>
                <p>Rosenberg asked if the country guidelines on declassification had been completed.
                    The reason for her question was to remind HDR that the Committee was interested
                    in how the new-style guidelines differed from the old ones. Pryor reported that
                    only five remained to be done. She did not know the details, however, and
                    suggested that the Committee raise the question with Bill Hamilton during the
                    afternoon session.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie commented on the draft <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    style guidance, observing that he regarded it as an evolutionary document, and
                    noting that the staff and the Committee were currently reviewing it at the same
                    time. He stated that the key elements in his editorial approach were scope and
                    selection policy. It is necessary to be highly selective and to prioritize the
                    sources. The legislation mandates coverage of “major” issues, and this approach
                    is designed to do this in a comprehensive way.</p>
                <p>Nelson questioned the meaning of expanding the scope of the series. LaFantasie
                    replied that this referred to drawing upon the materials of a wider range of
                    agencies and perhaps also presidential tapes.</p>
                <p>Nelson asked whether selecting fewer documents to print out of a wider range of
                    documents required more time than preparing a large volume. LaFantasie stated
                    that there was no way to measure that. We know as writers that it takes longer
                    to write carefully crafted short pieces, so we might say that it takes more time
                    to be more selective, but he is not sure if this <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8"
                        facs="0008"/> would be true of the series because PA/HO has a very
                    experienced staff. He has been to the LBJ Library and is aware of the scope of
                    the documents there. It is an amazing and sometimes overwhelming intellectual
                    challenge, requiring creativity. He has observed PA/HO compilers operating under
                    heavy pressure. Most of them have accomplished “Herculean tasks with great skill
                    and great accuracy.” He thinks they are capable of accomplishing the task.
                    Nelson expressed her concern about selectivity in a world of ever expanding
                    sources.</p>
                <p>Slany said LaFantasie is right to rely on the staff but the legislation imposes
                    requirements on other agencies. It requires them to provide more than passive
                    cooperation; he suggested that the agencies might be involved in identifying and
                    recommending particular records.</p>
                <p>Glad said PA/HO had been given an impossible task, to cover a wider range of
                    material within the time limit, with the same staff size. She asked what would
                    happen if a compiler discovered a whole area of documentation not previously
                    known. LaFantasie stated that we would try to deal with it. He noted that we
                    were sending a researcher to the Kennedy Library specifically to get some
                    additional material on British Guiana for the American Republics 1961-1963
                    microfiche.</p>
                <p>Page Miller said that the reason for the legislation was that the series is so
                    respected. The purpose of the legislation is to continue the quality of the
                    series. She espressed concern about the 800 page limit on the volumes and
                    wondered if this would not call into question the integrity of the series, since
                    it seemed clear that not all volumes should be the same length. This was not the
                    intent of the legislation.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie said that this was an average number and that some volumes would be
                    larger and some smaller. Regardless of the size of individual volumes, however,
                    the total number of pages would be less and selection of documents would be more
                    difficult. Apart from a few Founding Fathers projects, most documentary editing
                    projects are now more selective. He stated that previous volumes had some fat
                    and redundancy in them, so some reduction could be made without loss of
                    comprehensiveness. A compiler can make a case for a longer volume, and there
                    will be a process of negotiating the length of a volume. He is certain that some
                    topics would turn out to be less than 800 pages; there might be a trade-off of
                    200 pages in one volume for 200 pages in another. Budgetary constraints must
                    also be considered.</p>
                <p>Herring asked if specific volumes were far enough along to see how the new system
                    works. LaFantasie mentioned that the Johnson volumes on Arms Control and on
                    Cyprus were well along in the compiling phase.</p>
                <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0009"/>
                <p>Kimball read some statistics about the diminishing number of pages, from 12,600
                    pages per year in 1958-1960 and 11, 930 in 1961-1963, to 7, 300 planned for
                    1964-1968. He noted that this represents a reduction of nearly 5,000 pages per
                    year.</p>
                <p>Nelson noted that the new style guidance calls for providing bibliographic
                    references rather than summarizing documents not printed, but that the documents
                    may not be at the National Archives (NARA); the lot file may have been
                    destroyed. LaFantasie stated that there was no rigid rule; the compilers may
                    consider it necessary to summarize in some cases. Nelson asked if PA/HO would
                    try to exert some control over what is saved. Slany replied that this was the
                    logical corollary.</p>
                <p>Nelson inquired about the reference in the style guidance to “major” and “minor”
                    issues. LaFantasie replied that this was worked out during the planning of a
                    volume and as the research progressed. Other members asked for an example of a
                    “minor” issue. David Patterson offered the example of the issue of a nuclear
                    free zone in Latin America.</p>
                <p>George Chalou stated that he was encouraging agency historians and NARA appraisal
                    archivists to work together in making determinations on which records should be
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>Nelson questioned whether the PA/HO schedule should put more time pressure on
                    other agencies for declassification. LaFantasie stated that the schedule allows
                    a year for the declassification of a volume. Nelson asked why we should give
                    agencies more time than the statute provides? Slany replied that the current
                    declassification process required three stages, and it was difficult to
                    determine how long the clearance process would take in each case.</p>
                <p>Glad noted that the chart provided a basis for controlling speed but asked what
                    provision there was for quality control. LaFantasie said that he reviews every
                    manuscript and planned to have “outside” readers also review selected documents
                    for quality. Glad asked if time constraints might not lead a compiler to pass
                    over some issues. Slany said PA/HO might bring in outside experts. Herring said
                    that if outside consultants were used as a kind; of quality control, they would
                    be handicapped by not knowing what the full range of the record was for any
                    given compilation. LaFantasie pointed out that he had consulted Herring
                    concerning the question of an extra volume for Laos.</p>
                <p>The discussion returned to the question of volume size. LaFantasie said
                    suggestions on volume size should come from the compiler. Perkins asked if the
                    pages for the LBJ volumes could be gauged more accurately for planning purposes.
                    It was agreed <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0010"/> that the chart would be
                    revised to show some variation in the volume sizes as more accurate page
                    projections became known.</p>
                <p>Taylor questioned the style guidance against publishing a previously published
                    document, noting that this caused a problem of continuity. LaFantasie replied
                    that he preferred printing documents not previously printed, but the series
                    would take into account the significance of individual documents.</p>
                <p>Rosenberg asked whether PA/HO could provide more information to the Committee on
                    major topics to be covered in the volumes. She stated that the shrinkage in
                    coverage was a concern to all and wanted to know if more detailed tables of
                    contents, showing projected page counts, could be provided as volumes were being
                    compiled so the Committee could get into the process at an earlier stage. She
                    asked whether this would be too time consuming. LaFantasie replied that this
                    would take some time, but that it could and should be done. Kimball warned that
                    the Committee should not become involved in micromanaging and approving
                    individual volumes. Rosenberg agreed, noting that the Committee should neither
                    approve nor disapprove, but thought the detailed tables of contents would be
                    helpful to the Committee.</p>
                <p>Kimball invited Page Miller to comment on the question of a new executive order
                    on declassification. Miller stated that many groups are interested in this. The
                    AHA and other groups, such as the advisory group to DOD, have passed resolutions
                    calling for a new executive order. There is interest among some Capitol Hill
                    staffers, including on Hamilton’s staff and on the Senate side, in passing
                    legislation on this. Anthony Lake has served for a number of years on the board
                    of the National Security Archive and did research for a book there, so there is
                    reason to think he might be sympathetic. Drafting a new executive order is very
                    complex. Some people have approached Lake on this.</p>
                <p>The Committee recessed for lunch at noon.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" xml:id="closed-session--february-18--1-45-3-30-p-m-_1">

                <p>Kimball reconvened the Committee at 1:45 p.m. LaFantasie made a brief
                    presentation on the issue of Tibet. Schwar and PA/HO Asia and Americas Division
                    chief David Mabon had wanted the Committee to be aware of an editorial decision
                    on documents relating to Tibet in the 1958-1960 China compilation. The compilers
                    found very little documentation concerning Tibet, and portions of what little
                    they found could not be declassified. PA/HO believed that long-term efforts to
                    obtain additional release by the Deprtment and CIA had yielded all that could be
                    released and that further efforts would not be profitable.</p>
                <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0011"/>
                <p>There was agreement in PA/HO that the issue was not central to U.S. policy, so it
                    was decided to publish the volume without it and indicate in the preface that
                    documentation existed that could not be declassified. Some documentation might
                    be included in a later microfiche supplement for 1961-1963.</p>
                <p>Perkins asked to see the language that would be used in the preface. He expressed
                    concern that the sort of deletion from the series at issue with Tibet, even
                    though a minor part of the compilation, might constitute a distorted record.
                    Kimball suggested that since there seemed to be some unease on the part of the
                    Committee on this question that Perkins and Herring review the few documents on
                    Tibet and report back to the Committee before the end of the 2-day meeting.</p>
                <p>Acting Assistant Secretary for Administration Tolson addressed the Committee. He
                    indicated that because the Department was in a transition period, many senior
                    officials were not yet in place, and there was some uncertainty about policies
                    in a number of areas. He believed that management in the Department would put
                    the issue of implementation of the legislative requirement to declassify and
                    open the Department’s 30-year-old records high on the agenda. <hi rend="italic"

                        “Firm commitments could, therefore, <hi rend="underline">not</hi> be
                        made.”</note> Tolson said he senses a certain tension in the Committee
                    regarding the declassification process. Secretary Christopher yesterday had
                    devoted his third senior staff meeting, to review of the FOIA process. Tolson
                    indicated he had briefed the Under secretary for Management-designate
                    Atwood.</p>
                <p>Glad asked Tolson what he meant by “tension.” Tolson responded that some tension
                    was inevitable because of the inherently different perspectives of declassifiers
                    and the historical community, and he hoped disagreements could be solved
                    reasonably. Nelson said that both sides brought a lot of baggage to the table,
                    and it should be dropped in the spirit of the post-Cold War period. Tolson said
                    he had asked his people to reevaluate the issues in this spirit. <note n="**"
                        xml:id="p11fn4">HDR requests adding the following: “NOTE: HDR understands
                        Boucher advised S/S that no formal response was required and that he would
                        be speaking directly to Kimball concerning the January 5 report. In
                        addition, Fort responded in writing to the November letter.”</note></p>
                <p>Kimball responded that the Committee’s main concern was to carry out the spirit
                    and letter of the legislation. He noted that in late November the Committee had
                    sent a letter to Secretary of State Eagleburger presenting three recommendations
                    for dealing with the declassification and transfer of 30-year old records to the
                    National Archives, and had reiterated those <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12"
                        facs="0012"/> recommendations in the Committee’s annual report of January 5.
                    The Committee had not received a formal response to its letter or report.</p>
                <p>Kimball indicated that it would be a good time for the Department to reaffirm its
                    commitment to the 30-year rule. He urged that the Department, the National
                    Archives, and any other involved parties convene a high-level meeting to work on
                    cooperative measures toward meeting the 30-year requirement.</p>
                <p>Tolson stated that he was not in a position to speak on this issue for the
                    Assistant Secretary-designate for Administration, but pointed out that Secretary
                    Christopher’s high-level meeting on FOIA indicated the importance he placed on
                    the general issue of declassification.</p>
                <p>Van Camp asked Tolson if the briefings he had received included a briefing by the
                    Historian, in order to gain a different viewpoint. Tolson said he was aware of
                    the divergence of views and urged a briefing by the Historian for the Assistant
                    Secretary-designate. Warren Littrel, Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Information Management and Systems Operations, added that he had consulted with
                    Frank Machak and with PA, and he was committed to solving the problem. He was
                    interested in the Committee’s input and asked for their written comments.
                    Littrel also raised the possibility of convening a working group to develop new
                    solutions.</p>
                <p>Discussion then turned to the matter of bulk declassification. Machak said that
                    mere mention of this term frightens many people outside the Department of State,
                    in large measure because its meaning is vague and thus open to interpretation.
                    Rosenberg suggested that one option might be to develop guidelines that would
                    divide Department records into categories, each with its own declassification
                    process.</p>
                <p>Trudy Peterson, Assistant Archivist for the Office of the National Archives,
                    indicated that Steve Garfinkel, Director of ISOO, had been working that very
                    morning on draft language for a new executive order on declassification that
                    included something along the lines described by Rosenberg. Machak said that a
                    major problem in drafting such an executive order was getting input at the
                    earliest possible stage from the appropriate knowledgeable people. Machak had
                    recently met with Slany and Boucher to identify the right steps to obtain the
                    Committee’s input. It would be a challenge to gain consensus on the definition
                    of bulk declassification to prepare for its implementation. Nelson reminded the
                    Committee that bulk declassification did not mean that documents weren’t
                    reviewed individually.</p>
                <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0013"/>
                <p>Peterson referred to Page Miller’s comments on the Moynihan Bill (S. 157) that
                    morning, and referred to a recent CRS Issue Brief on the history of the
                    declassification issue, which she offered to share with the Committee. Putting
                    an executive order on declassification before the NSC was at the top of ISOO’s
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>In response to a question from Nelson on FOIA, Machak indicated that Secretary
                    Christopher’s interests were broad and reassuring. The Secretary was also
                    interested in his own records. With respect to language for an executive order,
                    Machak felt that there should be agreement on terminology. For example, the term
                    “systematic review” was better applied to the central files than to lot files or
                    post files. In reviewing the 1950-1954 record bloc, there was a tremendous
                    problem in dealing with personnel records. Some parts of the 1955-1959 bloc
                    involved difficult problems with CIA records.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">[</hi>In the drafting of an executive order, Machak felt that
                    the entire spectrum of ideas should be put on the table, with nothing ruled out.
                    It was especially important that the Committee’s views be heard. It was
                    important in the drafting process that the right people become engaged, and that
                    they persevere. The major problem was likely to be implementation. other
                    agencies often did not have an appreciation of the difficulties the State
                    Department would face in implementation.</p>
                <p>Machak also proposed consideration of prioritizing, with Committee assistance,
                    declassification of the Department files so that those most needed could be
                    opened earliest. He also suggested a procedure for special access by scholars to
                    still-closed portions of Department files.</p>
                <p>Machak then expressed the view that in solving the problem of meeting the
                    Department’s legislative mandate, it was important for the Department add NARA
                    to agree on a detailed, well-defined position before broaching the subject to a
                    group of high-level State officials with decisionmaking authority, or broadening
                    the discussion to include other agencies. Gaining a consensus in the Department
                    would not be easy if the declassification process were to move from “low-risk”
                    page-by-page review to a “higher risk” but less time-consuming alternative;.<hi

                    <note n="*" xml:id="p13fn5">HDR asserts that Machak said his comments were “off

                    there would be a certain element of risk. Slany suggested that failure to meet
                    public expectation and need of access to historical records was an area of
                    greater risk for the Department.</p>
                <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0014"/>
                <p>There was some discussion of the mechanism of declassification and examples.
                    Peterson said that NARA had for some time favored use of a “drop dead date” for
                    declassification of records. Kimball suggested that one solution for the
                    Department would be to set a date on which records would be open. Agencies then
                    would have 6 months in which to review their documents in the Department
                    records, at their own expense, and to decide which of their documents should be
                    declassified. At the end of the 6-month period all documents except those
                    withheld by the agencies would become available to the public.</p>
                <p>Kimball then indicated that Congress would expect a report from the Department,
                    now 4 months overdue, that addressed the declassification issue in some detail.
                    Littrel urged an internal report laying out options for Department management.
                        <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Machak expressed his personal opinion that

                <p>Rosenberg expressed dismay that the Committee had not moved beyond the position
                    taken two meetings ago on this issue. She was under the impression that the
                    Committee had asked for some proposals from the National Archives or wherever
                    appropriate. The Committee could not design the system. She suggested a working
                    group to bring alternative proposals together, in keeping with the Committee’s
                    November report. Chaddic indicated that whereas he had hot favored earlier
                    language calling for “high-level meetings” he did favor a “working group.” There
                    was some discussion of the proposed working group, which would seek to delineate
                    the alternatives and present them to a higher level. The working group would
                    include representation from the Advisory Committee, the National Archives,
                    Information Management, the Historian, and bureaus of the Department. Rosenberg
                    urged that the working group meet soon in order to present some ideas in
                    briefing materials for the new Assistant Secretary. Littrel welcomed the
                    proposal for a working group and offered to assist PA and the Committee in
                    establishing it.</p>
                <p>The Committee recessed at 3:25 for a break.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" xml:id="closed-session--february-18--3-45-4-45-p-m-_1">
                <head><hi rend="underline">Closed Session, February 18, 3:45-4:45 p.m.</hi></head>
                <p>The Committee reconvened at 3:45 and continued its discussion of the suggestion
                    that a Department of State working group be established to come up with
                    proposals regarding ways <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0015"/> to improve and
                    speed up the declassification process for Department records. Kimball pointed
                    out that a working group might not come up with workable solutions even if given
                    a 30-45 day deadline and might even delay implementation of a solution. A
                    working group could be a two-edged sword. Therefore, Kimball recommended that
                    establishment of a working group be tied to an extremely strong recommendation
                    regarding high-level action so this would not just end up on the Secretary’s
                    desk.</p>
                <p>Perkins agreed and said that this should be proposed in a Committee letter to the
                    Assistant Secretary. Kimball said that his letter would go to Acting Assistant
                    Secretary for Public Affairs Richard Boucher and to Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    for Information Management and Systems Operations Warren Littrel so that they
                    would be informed regarding the deadlines that should be met. Glad pointed out
                    that they needed to come up with feasible alternatives, not just high-sounding
                    principles. Kimball recalled that Rosenberg had said that the first task should
                    be to prepare briefing materials, but said that he wondered whether this was
                    necessary. Rosenberg explained that she had not meant that every detail needed
                    to be tied up, but was talking about general directions such as a drop-dead date
                    to declassify documents. Could the Committee ask for a high-level meeting and
                    say here are some alternatives?</p>
                <p>Kimball asked whether the Committee was agreed that they should give the working
                    group a relatively short deadline and specify that the next stage would be a
                    high-level meeting with both NARA and the Department of State involved. Herring
                    asked who would take charge. Rosenberg said that Littrel would be a good person,
                    noting that he had been involved with the issues. The Committee urged that
                    Kimball call Littrel and ask if he were willing to convene the working group.
                    Kimball suggested that the working group should be co-convened by Littrel and
                    Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Richard Boucher.</p>
                <p>Herring asked whether the Committee would have a say concerning who would serve
                    on the working group. If every bureau were represented, as had been suggested,
                    would this be a problem? Slany said that Machak was genuinely concerned about
                    this. Glad pointed out that the Committee as a whole could vote on the
                    recommendations. Kimball asked Chaddic if the working group’s report would be
                    classified. Chaddic replied that he had no idea. He pointed out that having
                    representatives from each bureau would involve more players who would thus be
                    educated concerning the process. Chaddic added that he needed advice from the
                    Committee. He also pointed out that this would not be a decisionmaking group,
                    even at a high level, unless there were clear, specific alternatives.</p>
                <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0016"/>
                <p>Kimball warned that the Committee should not delay the process. The working group
                    probably should have been set up 18 months ago. It was decided that the product
                    of the working group would probably be unclassified or easily sanitized and
                    could be distributed to the members of the Committee by fax, courier, or mail.
                    Kimball noted that he could call a meeting to consider the working group’s
                    recommendations, even if not everyone could come. Rosenberg agreed and argued
                    that they should keep the possibility of a meeting open depending on when the
                    Assistant Secretary was appointed. She noted that the Committee might not like
                    all of the options proposed in the working group’s report. Kimball said that the
                    Committee could discuss this in conference calls and then decide whether another
                    Committee meeting was called for.</p>
                <p>Van Camp said that she was concerned about how the Committee should communicate
                    what it was doing to other government historical advisory committees. Kimball
                    said that there was currently no liaision with other advisory committees. Slany
                    noted that they could invite representatives from other committees to attend the
                    next meeting. Kimball asked Slany if he could get a list of such committees. Van
                    Camp suggested that the Committee should also keep Steve Garfinkel of ISOO and
                    Page Miller informed. Kimball noted that he sent copies of most Committee
                    correspondence to Page Miller. Van Camp suggested that they also send
                    information to Steve Garfinkel. Kimball said that this would not be a problem
                    and noted that he could send him a copy of the minutes.</p>
                <p>Perkins said that, despite Machak’s recommendation, he hoped that the working
                    group would recommend legislation. Kimball asked if there were any volunteers to
                    serve on the working group. He asked who had been on the old declassification
                    subcommittee. Nelson replied that she had been on the subcommittee, but that she
                    should not be on this one. She noted that she had been fighting this battle too
                    long. Rosenberg said that she could not do it during the next six weeks. Glad
                    said she would do it if no one else could. Rosenberg said that the working group
                    should deal with archival practices, so Van Camp should be on it. Van Camp said
                    that she would like to do it, but noted that this depended on the time. Herring
                    said he could not do it during the next six weeks. Taylor urged Nelson to be on
                    the working group. Kimball noted that they all had other responsibilities.
                    Therefore, there should be three people serving on a rotating basis. He was
                    putting Nelson, Van Camp, and Taylor on the list, with Glad as a backstop.
                    Kimball said that there might be scheduling problems, and he would be available
                    to serve part-time as well. He would work on the scheduling with Littrel.</p>

                <p>The Committee turned its attention to the report of the subcommittee on
                    declassification of <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961-1963, Vol.
                    XVII, The Middle East, 1961-1962. <note n="*" xml:id="p17fn7">Representatives of
                        the Bureau of Administration (IMIS/FPC) attended some sessions of this
                        meeting, including this particular session, at the invitation of the
                        Advisory Committee and its Executive Secretary. Their attendance at this
                        session does not imply their acceptance or endorsement of views or opinions
                        expressed by others or responsibility for possible errors or omissions in
                        the meeting record.</note> The subcommittee consisted of Rosenberg, Kimball,
                    and Van. Camp. Rosenberg reported that there were 24 documents which had not yet
                    been denied but had been flagged by the NEA Bureau as “of concern.” The
                    subcommittee had reviewed the 24 documents and had met with the desk officer,
                    [Tom Miller, and the HDR reviewer, Sid Sober. Rosenberg said that the
                    subcommittee had trouble seeing what the concern was. The desk officer had said
                    that the problem was national security. When they told him that the legislation
                    stipulated that grounds for denial had to be document-specific, the desk officer
                    had been appalled and had not been aware of this. The subcommittee had given the
                    desk officer a copy of the legislation and the relevant documents, and he had
                    expressed chagrin that he would have to read this material. Pryor had offered to
                    walk him through the process. Miller said he would consider the documents more
                    carefully and get back in touch with HDR and PA/HO. Meanwhile, Rosenberg said,
                    nothing had been resolved.</p>
                <p>In response to a question by Nelson, Rosenberg explained the substantive issue in
                    question. She said that one 1963 memorandum had already been declassified, along
                    with relevant documentation published in the 1958-1960 <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> compilation, and argued that this would make
                    omission of these documents more damaging. Kimball noted that Sid Sober had been
                    greatly concerned about the reaction of the Israeli Government to release of
                    this material. Van Camp reported that although the desk officer had not been
                    prepared to discuss the documents with the subcommittee in any detail, one
                    particular document had been discussed in detail. The Department of State had
                    asked the Embassy in Israel for the Government of Israel’s reaction to the
                    sensitivity of one specific document which was full of quotes by an Israeli
                    official. Israel had responded a month or so later that it considered the
                    document Top Secret and it could not be released.</p>
                <p>Van Camp expressed her concern that the Department of State had consulted the
                    Israeli Government before making a determination on the 24 documents. This one
                    document related to all the others at issue. Kimball noted that Sid Sober had
                    been surprised because he had gotten 60 other documents declassified. Kimball
                    pointed out that this particular document involved such full treatment of the
                    issue that its release would have allowed release of the other 23. This would
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0018"/> have been, great if it had worked.
                    As things now stood, by selecting the most sensitive document of the 24 to be
                    reviewed and rejected by the Israelis, the Department may have jeopardized the
                    chances for release of the other 23.</p>
                <p>Pryor pointed out that the NEA Bureau initially had decided to deny the 24
                    documents in full and that Sid Sober had tried to create an opening by asking
                    the Israeli Government how sensitive the documents were. Otherwise, all of them
                    would have been denied. She said that Miller had read the documents and was not
                    being slack. He had been at the Department since 6:30 a.m. that day. Although he
                    had a horrible cold, he was fully engaged in preparing for the Secretary of
                    State’s trip to the Middle East that night. If he had appeared abrupt or
                    cavalier in his discussion of the documents with the subcommittee it was due to
                    these preoccupations and not to any lack of interest.</p>
                <p>Chaddic stated that HDR and the Bureau had followed normal practice, and noted
                    that HDR had the authority to deny declassification and did not have to go
                    beyond this. He had sent a new telegram to the Embassy in Israel, asking the
                    Israeli Foreign Ministry to reconsider, but it might be another 3-4 weeks before
                    HDR received a response. Chaddic noted that HDR thought NEA was being too
                    restrictive.</p>
                <p>Kimball pointed out that the document picked had problems because it contained
                    extensive quotes by a high Israeli Government official. Statements by U.S.
                    officials might have been more easily cleared. Chaddic noted that the Department
                    did not yet know what the National Security Council would do in their review of
                    some of the documents at issue. Pryor also pointed out that the Israeli
                    note-taker in the document in question created additional sensitivities. Kimball
                    said that he still questioned HDR’s methodology because this denial would affect
                    clearance of the other documents, chaddic and Noring said that they did not
                    agree that this clouded all 24 documents. Pryor said that the meeting had
                    clarified the issue for Tom Miller. In light of the sensitivity of the matter at
                    issue, the question now was which would be worse -- release or withholding?</p>
                <p>Rosenberg stated that she had not meant to criticize Sober or Miller, but argued
                    that if HDR’s procedure had made this an issue in current U.S.-Israeli
                    relations, this would affect the appeal. Pryor reiterated that the documents
                    would have been denied anyway and repeated that the issue was now clarified.
                    Kimball agreed but said it was now a current issue. Noring commented that this
                    issue had become highly sensitive during the 1970s.</p>
                <p>Herschler indicated that the 24 documents likely would not all be denied in toto
                    but that the sensitive issue might be withheld from all 24. Kimball said that if
                    that were to be the <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0019"/> case, “we’re off to
                    the races.” He pointed out that the 1958-1960 volume mentioned this issue and
                    argued that such excisions would be ridiculous and create not only a gap in the
                    record but a distortion. Kimball said that there were people within the
                    Department of state and outside who did not understand what the Committee was
                    doing. He repeated that Tom Miller had been surprised. PA/HO should remind the
                    Bureau at every opportunity. Pryor said that Sober and Miller would mark up the
                    documents and have the referrals to the other agencies completed by early March.

                <head><hi rend="underline">Closed Session, February 19, 9-10:30 a.m.</hi></head>
                <p>The session convened at 9:10. Rosenberg explained that Kimball and Slany were
                    meeting for coffee with Littrel to discuss the proposed working group and asked
                    that the meeting proceed without them. LaFantasie would deliver the report on
                    access in Slany’s absence.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie acknowledged prior expressed concerns by the Committee on the quality
                    of access to other agency documents being experienced by PA/HO staff members. He
                    reminded the Committee that PA/HO had negotiated and executed access agreements
                    with a number of other government agencies involved in the foreign policy
                    process, but that a few of these agencies had yet to reach an agreement. Those
                    agencies were generally prepared to provide access and did not see the need for
                    a formal understanding.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie said that while on the surface the system of access for <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> research appeared to be functioning,
                    this did not meant that PA/HO was getting to all the documents it needed or
                    obtaining them in an efficient manner.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie explained that this progress report was based on written reports
                    submitted by Division Chiefs and the oral testimony of several compilers.</p>
                <p>He began with the CIA. He emphasized that PA/HO historians are going to the CIA
                    and seeing CIA documents, and that the CIA is being very cooperative, but there
                    are difficulties in this process. CIA records are compartmentalized, and this
                    creates a problem. CIA historians assigned to PA/HO researchers act as
                    intermediaries with the CIA records managers. The CIA historians don’t know
                    fully what records exist and must rely on what CIA records managers tell them.
                    Consequently, PA/HO does not know the universe of documents at the CIA and it
                    may never know. While PA/HO and the CIA Historical Staff try to solve this
                    problem, <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> readers must be informed in
                    the preface to the volumes.</p>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0020"/>
                <p>[At this point, Slany and Kimball entered the room, as did CIA Chief Historian J.
                    Kenneth McDonald.]</p>
                <p>In response to a question from Perkins about CIA finding aids, LaFantasie said
                    that the universe of records was a very dark one. He noted that there was also a
                    problem of source citation and remarked that the recent CIA publication on the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis also lacked source citations. McDonald interjected that the
                    sources for these published documents were in fact identified (by office, date,
                    author, etc.), although the volume did not cite CIA job numbers. LaFantasie
                    continued that this was not the standard way historians dealt with
                    documents.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie then described a feeling among HO historians that some of the new
                    historians at CIA do not know the extent of their holdings. He observed that
                    there were a number of new people there and it would take time for them to gain
                    familiarity with their sources and to understand the kinds of documents that <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> needs. The problem was that the
                    series could not wait for CIA to get up to speed as it must push on. It was not
                    a question of sensitive material being withheld, but rather the feeling that not
                    everything was being seen.</p>
                <p>Asked for a case in point, LaFantasie suggested that CIA material submitted to
                    the Church Committee Hearings was not entirely available. Nelson asked whether
                    PA/HO had checked with Committee staffers who still lived in Washington?
                    LaFantasie said he was not sure how far individual compilers had extended their
                    searches. McDonald said that it was difficult to respond to the Historian’s
                    Office concerns because this was the first he had heard of them and he had not
                    been informed that there were any problems. In fact, the CIA History Staff could
                    arrange immediate access to the Agency’s records of the Church Committee
                    investigations, if any Department of State historian should request it. McDonald
                    added that as far as he knew, no state compiler had yet requested access to
                    these records. Perkins asked whether Congressional committees did not keep their
                    files? Nelson said that the CIA had tried to get access to Church Committee
                    records and had been denied access by the Congress. McDonald agreed.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie stressed the fact that the CIA History Staff has been cooperative and
                    the relationship productive. Personal relations were close and friendly, <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> editors were obtaining documents the
                    like of which they had never seen before, but he felt the need to communicate to
                    the readers that there were limitations on the extent of access.</p>
                <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0021"/>
                <p>Perkins warned that such a statement in the preface must be framed very carefully
                    or many readers will assume that the CIA was “playing games” in providing
                    access. LaFantasie such an assumption was possible, but he stressed that the
                    alternative -- saying nothing about these problems -- was not acceptable.
                    Perkins suggested language to the effect that CIA recordkeeping practices make
                    research difficult.</p>
                <p>Glad said she disagreed with Perkins. She said that if the written statement
                    talked about progress and then discussed the issue, it would be informative. She
                    then asked McDonald whether CIA had any automatic declassification dates.</p>
                <p>McDonald explained that while there was no automatic declassification at any
                    date, there was a program for systematic declassification review of most of
                    CIA’s records that are 30 years old or older. He observed that CIA ’s records
                    were not organized to facilitate eventual historical research, but to support
                    the function they served at the time they were created. Codeword
                    compartmentalization of information and other security procedures create special
                    problems in historical research at CIA; for example, many CIA documents
                    (especially from the Agency’s early years) do not identify their origin-office,
                    directorate, or CIA.</p>
                <p>Glad thought that it was important that <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes specify as accurately as possible what the editors
                    had seen and not seen. McDonald indicated that many of the problems described by
                    LaFantasie would likely be resolved, but some of them were endemic based on
                    security considerations.</p>
                <p>Perkins suggested the problem lay in the lack of good finding aids. McDonald
                    observed that while this is often true for the records of the Directorate of
                    Operations, there are much better finding aids for research in Directorate of
                    Intelligence records. This difference was not surprising, he explained, since
                    the Directorate of Operations is an action-oriented organization, whose work,
                    both in foreign intelligence collection and in covert action, is usually done
                    under tight time and security constraints. The Directorate for Intelligence, on
                    the other hand, is a research organization whose analysts ordinarily have
                    graduate training in such fields as history, politics, economics, and area
                    studies. This directorate’s analytical function explains why its records are
                    typically well-organized for research.</p>
                <p>Slany emphasized that of the big three agencies -- Presidential Libraries,
                    Defense, and CIA -- as well as other less important agencies, the CIA was the
                    most pro-active, better than all but Presidential Libraries; certainly much
                    better than USIA or AID which were not very cooperative, saying in effect, you
                    can use our documents but you must do it <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0022"/>
                    yourself. He stressed the tremendous amount of work done by Presidential
                    libraries before PA/HO visits in preparing the way for the research.</p>
                <p>Fawcett said that all repositories shared some of the problems being discussed.
                    Researchers at the National Archives frequently asked NARA staff for assurances
                    that they had seen everything and such assurances could not be given. In that
                    case, you need a disclaimer for all sources. LaFantasie countered that at the
                    LBJ Library you know exactly what is there. Fawcett observed that the Library
                    had 25 years to get its files in order.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie continued his report by mentioning the second difficulty with other
                    agencies: lack of assistance. Photocopying has been a problem. If PA/HO cannot
                    make photocopies of documents, work is impeded. Right now, for example, with
                    work we are doing at Suitland, most boxes have to be transferred back to the
                    agencies before we can photocopy them. Or the machine supplied to us is down. We
                    will likely have to get our own machines in these places.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie said that PA/HO will focus on the procedures to solve these problems.
                    We are going to try to get the other agencies to stop insisting that the records
                    be sent back before they can be photocopied. The Suitland staff has made
                    available research space and access to a photocopy machine in a mail room close
                    to the research room, but this machine does not appear to be adequate.</p>
                <p>LaFantasie continued that right now historians write endless letters seeking
                    access and transferring clearances and this needs to be streamlined. Individual
                    compilers have to confront these chores daily. Herschler then explained the
                    physical circumstances of doing work in other agency records at Suitland.</p>
                <p>Nelson then asked about the quality of assistance given for OSD and JCS records.
                    Keefer responded that JCS has been more forthcoming than OSD. The JCS kept very
                    good records, which are at the Archives. In response to a series of questions
                    from Nelson, Keefer defined three areas of problems: (1) the procedural problems
                    involved in gaining access; (2) the problem of not seeing everything relevant to
                    the subject; and (3) the tremendous bulk of the material that PA/HO historians
                    had to go through. It appeared that OSD threw nothing out. The files of the
                    Secretary of Defense were massive. Keefer mentioned that there were 200 cubic
                    foot boxed of Secretary of Defense files on the Far East for the Johnson
                    period.</p>
                <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0023"/>
                <p>In response to a question from Nelson about finding aids Herschler indicated that
                    PA/HO had access to the SF 135s for DOD records retired to Suitland. Langbart
                    suggested that within a given OSD documentary collection, historians could look
                    in the first box to find a guide. The number system used in OSD records during
                    the 1960s was the same used by the U.S. Army since World War II.</p>
                <p>Nelson reiterated the need for PA/HO to complete an access agreement with DOD.
                    Kimball agreed that he would push for this by writing a letter. Rosenberg
                    suggested inviting a representative from DOD to future Advisory Committee
                    meetings. Slany indicated that would be a good idea.</p>
                <p>Patterson said that he had looked at a number of ACDA and AID records, and asked
                    whether there was some way to determine which records were to be transferred to
                    NARA -- and when -- and which were to be destroyed. Langbart mentioned the 01
                    Report, a NARA printout that was updated on a monthly basis, that contained the
                    status of various agency files at the Records Center that were scheduled for
                    either retention or destruction. He mentioned procedures that PA/HO historians
                    could go through to see that specific bodies of documents were maintained.
                    Patterson responded that PA/HO historians should be given the name of the
                    relevant archivist who they could contact to discuss the records’ disposition.
                    Langbart promised to send PA/HO a copy of the 01 Report and a NARA list of
                    assignments of appraisal archivists.</p>
                <p>Kimball wanted to know why PA/HO historians couldn’t just stamp a document
                    “save”. Langbart explained that NARA saved collections of documents and not
                    individual ones. At times, there may be only one good document for publication
                    in <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> in a collection that was
                    determined not to be worth saving. In that case, the document would be destroyed
                    with the rest of the collection. Van Camp indicated the need for a dialog
                    between PA/HO and the Archives concerning what documents should be saved.</p>
                <p>Kimball mentioned that a select committee of Nelson, Perkins, and Glad were going
                    to CIA for lunch.</p>
                <p>McDonald then reported on the work of CIA’s Center for the Study of Intelligence
                    (CSI), whose History Staff and Historical Review Group were both committed to
                    making more CIA documentation available to scholars. Noting that four new staff
                    historians had joined the History Staff since last July, he predicted that the
                    strong support CSI and the History Staff had received from Robert Gates as DCI
                    would continue under the new Director, James Woolsey. He also explained that
                    while the History Staff serves as a broker for State historians’ access to CIA
                    records, it was CSI’s Historical Review Group, headed by <pb n="24"
                        xml:id="pg_24" facs="0024"/> John Pereira, that dealt with declassification.
                    He noted that both John Pereira and the Director of CSI, David Gries, would be
                    at today’s luncheon for three Advisory Committee members at CIA
                    Headquarters.</p>
                <p>McDonald said the problems described by LaFantasie are real, and that the History
                    Staff was eager to work with the Department of State to resolve them. While
                    several of his historians were new to the History Staff, they were experienced
                    Directorate of Intelligence analysts who have PhDs in diplomatic history. It was
                    important for State historians to be quite clear about the kind of documents
                    they were seeking for their <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes,
                    and for Slany or LaFantasie to let CIA’s Chief Historian know if State compilers
                    are running into difficulties.</p>
                <p>McDonald admitted that the recordkeeping of the Directorate of Operations had
                    tremendous problems. He spoke then of the differences in CIA ability to respond
                    to PA/HO requests on Guatemala (1954) and Iran (1953). They had retrieved
                    several hundred boxes of documents on Guatemala. PA/HO had not sent anybody over
                    yet to look at them. His staff had obtained only a handful of documents on Iran.
                    McDonald did not know why it had been more difficult for Iran; he said the
                    subject was not any more sensitive than Guatemala. Kimball said PA/HO should
                    examine both the Guatemala and Iran collections.</p>
                <p>Herring asked whether CIA intended to release more documentary collections, such
                    as the Cuba volume. McDonald said that the next one would be a volume on Soviet
                    Estimates. He said that they had enough material to do a publication on
                    Guatemala but not on Iran; publications would have to wait while they focused on
                    the Soviet Estimate volume. A Guatemala publication would take 2-3 years to do
                    and they did not want to delay the Estimate publication. McDonald said that he
                    hoped eventually to make public the CIA studies on these two countries.</p>
                <p>Nelson asked if just the documents cited in the Cuba volume would be transferred
                    to the National Archives. McDonald replied that the volume’s documents, as
                    printed, would be transferred to the Archives now, while the tabs, attachments,
                    and sections of these documents deleted for reasons of space would be reviewed
                    and transferred to the National Archives later as they were declassified.</p>
                <p>Kimball suggested that the three Committee members going to the CIA for lunch
                    could further explore these issues. He then focused the discussion on various
                    outstanding matters -- unanswered questions from previous meetings. He asked the
                    Committee if they were satisfied with the boilerplate for the prefaces. He
                    himself was unsure about the preface for <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0025"/>
                    1958-1960 Africa. Schwar pointed out that the Africa volume had already been
                    published. Kimball agreed that it would not be necessary for the Committee to
                    approve the already published preface. After some discussion the Committee
                    accepted the boilerplate preface language they had tentatively agreed to at the
                    November meeting.</p>
                <p>Kimball wanted to know if PA/HO had asked NSA for any documentation. Slany said
                    that NSA resisted doing an agreement and that PA/HO had not requested access for
                    any of its historians to do research. Herring raised the Gulf of Tonkin
                    intercepts. Keefer said that PA/HO had asked for the intercepts at the time the
                    1964 volume was compiled, but had not gotten them. Fawcett said that the LBJ
                    Library had also sought the intercepts, but NSA had denied them. Fawcett
                    explained that it was a technology question, rather than the content of them,
                    that was at issue.</p>
                <p>Nelson said that PA/HO and the Committee could not fight every battle there was
                    to fight. She asked how important were NSA records for the coverage of foreign
                    policy? Kimball said it would have to be case oriented. He mentioned the
                    importance of such records for understanding Pearl Harbor. Herring mentioned the
                    relationship of MAGIC to the decision to drop the atomic bomb. Fawcett confirmed
                    that the Gulf of Tonkin was very important.</p>
                <p>Slany said PA/HO could not ask NSA for records if we did not know what they had.
                    Slany said that NSA must become more proactive, in a manner similar to CIA.
                    Slany said we can guess what the key issues are, but we do not know. The person
                    to work with at NSA was David Gaddy.</p>
                <p>Van Camp asked if the legislative requirement for access covered NSA. Kimball
                    confirmed this, adding that memoranda sometimes get lost in the forest. The
                    Committee should write a letter and tie it to a specific request for access by
                    PA/HO to NSA records that were especially relevant.</p>
                <p>In response to a question by Perkins, McDonald explained that NSA had three
                    historians and two contractors. Hank Schorreck was in charge of the operation,
                    which was organized with the NSA records management function. According to
                    McDonald, the NSA history staff had good, experienced people. They did some oral
                    histories.</p>
                <p>Kimball said that he had previously suggested that CIA and HDR talk about the new
                    declassification guidelines. McDonald responded that that was John Perreira’s
                    responsibility, but he thought there was considerable contact with HDR. Chaddic
                    confirmed this.</p>
                <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0026"/>
                <p>Kimball then asked about PA/HO historians having access to CIA finding aids.
                    McDonald said you needed first to find the finding aids. He was uncertain to
                    what extent his own historians had seen such finding aids, that Mary McAuliffe
                    could best answer that, but he would ask her. He did say PA/HO historians could
                    see them when his staff was able to obtain them.</p>
                <p>Kimball raised the subject of the Department of Energy declassification backlog.
                    Pryor reported that the DOE backlog had been reduced by two-thirds. The Arms
                    Control volume for 1961-1963 was still outstanding, but she saw no need for the
                    Committee to become involved in DOE’s lateness.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked about whether the list of available <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes had been published. After some confusion over the
                    difference between this report and the Perkins chart, LaFantasie said that it
                    had been published in the Cold War project newsletter. <note n="*"
                        xml:id="p26fn8">PA/HO subsequently learned that although the availability
                        chart was obtainable from the Historian’s Office, it was not printed in the
                        Cold War project newsletter.</note> The Committee felt that this publication
                    was not widely disseminated and that a better forum for publication should be
                    found.</p>
                <p>Kimball raised the subject of declassification delays of <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> manuscripts at other agencies. Pryor asked McDonald
                    to take up with Pereira the fact that CIA was behind schedule on a number of
                    volumes. She said that she spoke weekly with her counterpart at the CIA review
                    staff, Gloria Boyd, on this subject. She said that these outstanding volumes
                    were otherwise clean and could go to the NSC promptly. Three volumes had been at
                    CIA since last summer. Kimball asked the three Committee members going to the
                    CIA for lunch to gently prod the agency about these volumes.</p>
                <p>The Committee recessed at 10:30.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" xml:id="closed-session--february-19--10-45-a-m--noon_1">
                <head><hi rend="underline">Closed Session, February 19, 10:45 a.m.-Noon</hi></head>
                <p>In opening this session at 10:55 a.m., Kimball expressed the thanks of the entire
                    Advisory Committee for Jeanne Pryor’s work these past months. She has moved
                    things along and has made a difference, he said, and the Committee wanted to
                    thank her.</p>
                <p>Ken Rossman initiated discussion on the subject of electronic records. He
                    introduced Pat Magan of his staff who has been working on the question of
                    electronic mail since late summer 1992. Then came Judge Richey’s decision, which
                    applies to the Executive Office of the President and is not binding on <pb
                        n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0027"/> the Department of State, but he saw the
                    decision as an opportunity to firm up Department policies. A draft of this
                    policy had almost been cleared before the Richey decision complicated the issue.
                    The Richey decision addressed the issue that the EOP had not provided sufficient
                    guidelines on electronic records (specifically E-Mail) and the agency’s
                    procedures were arbitrary and capricious. Yesterday Rossman received a
                    memorandum from NARA addressing the Judge’s decision that printing a copy of
                    E-Mail is inadequate and that the agency must preserve the electronic version.
                    The question that also arises is, what constitutes a record?</p>
                <p>Rossman believed that the Department’s draft guidance on E-mail should ask
                    certain questions to allow users of E-mail to evaluate the record status of the
                    information they produce. Rossman stated that we must be more sophisticated now
                    in determining the record status of E-mail. He outlined four levels: E-mail may
                    be records; E-mail may be important; E-mail may need to be preserved; E-mail may
                    need to be preserved permanently.</p>
                <p>Kimball inquired whether the White House was involved in the Department’s study.
                    He was concerned about the different viewpoints between the State Department and
                    the other agencies. Fawcett interjected that the White House had to follow much
                    more exhaustive and cumbersome procedures, but it would be foolish for the whole
                    government to follow them. In essence, Richey applied a forensic test: could it
                    be used as evidence in a court room? We save only one percent of federal records
                    now, but Richey would require nearly everything to be saved, which could cripple
                    the routine recordkeeping of agencies.</p>
                <p>Nelson inquired, could we hot distinguish between offices? Administrative
                    records, for instance, could be disposed of in 5-10 years, but not the records
                    of the Secretary of State. Fawcett responded that it would be difficult for
                    agencies to make that sort of distinction, since only a small portion of all
                    electronic mail would be considered a permanent record. Rossman noted that we
                    can make paper copies of important electronic records. Van Camp pointed out that
                    E-mail and paper files are not the same thing. There is a gray area between the
                    two.</p>
                <p>Glad noted that presidential scholars derive some amusement in investigating how
                    the President spends his day. She asked who makes the decision to destroy
                    E-mail, noting the arbitrary nature of E-mail producers’ judgment in what should
                    be saved. Fawcett said that E-mail cannot: be destroyed at the White House. In
                    any case, as Iran-Contra players discovered, backups were on the main frame.
                    Rossman added that his role was not to prevent the destruction of E-mail but to
                    provide guidance on <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0028"/> its handling. The
                    earlier draft guidance especially emphasized the saving of paper copies. The
                    Department’s concept of attaching an envelope to electronic documents
                    potentially would enable assignment of a disposition to the document.</p>
                <p>Kimball remarked that the criminal trial aspects to the preservation of E-mail
                    documents is “loose cannon” criteria, and we don’t want that. Fawcett added that
                    in an archival sense a record is a record whether it is electronic or on paper.
                    Rossman continued that E-mail is an advance in the sense that it takes the place
                    of some phone calls that might otherwise be lost. In the passport imbroglio all
                    E-mail records were requested by the Independent Counsel, as well as many
                    administrative records, including entrances to and exits from buildings. Fawcett
                    noted that passcard information is not normally preserved, but in this
                    investigation it was preserved immediately. Herschler added that in this case
                    what was supposed to be short-term documentation became long-term and perhaps
                    permanent records. Fawcett then pointed out that the NSC had undertaken a study,
                    resulting in the reconfiguration of the electronic messaging software so that it
                    would generate more detailed log records, perhaps obviating Richey’s decision
                    that logs are insufficient as records because they lack critical data.</p>
                <p>Kimball then asked whether Rossman had any advice on this matter. Rossman replied
                    that not all records are created equal; he reiterated that they have diverse
                    values. Kimball agreed but said it was nonetheless a hot item and would not go
                    away. Nelson stated that she hoped that Rossman would come to SHAFR and other
                    professional meetings to talk about this issue. Van Camp mentioned that the
                    Reagan Library is doing a lot of looking at E-mail. This was different from the
                    “real” records of the State Department. Students will have to become acquainted
                    with the Department’s central file which has been partially electronic since
                    1973.</p>
                <p>Kimball proposed and Rossman and the Committee agreed to have further discussion
                    on this issue at the next Committee meeting. Rossman said he would speak to the
                    technical changes that have made the records more useful since 1973, and he
                    believed this was a hopeful aspect to the electronic records question.</p>
                <p>Glad asked who owns E-mail? Who determines this and at what level and at what
                    stage? Can the officer take his disks with him? Rossman responded that he
                    supervised the removal of James Baker’s personal record. Baker took only a few
                    documents with him, and Rossman personally reviewed all of them and verified
                    that all were copies. Kimball continued that Rossman can provide the Committee
                    with a draft of the report on electronic records prior to the next meeting, if
                    he wished, and <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0029"/> the Committee would
                    respond quickly. The next meeting would be in 2-3 months. He reiterated his
                    understanding that whatever is defined as a “record” is covered under the law.
                    He said that Warren Christopher has taken a strong position on this.</p>
                <p>The Committee then turned to consider David Herschler’s written report on the
                    tape recordings at the Presidential libraries. Herschler said he received
                    extensive cooperation from archivists at the Presidential libraries as well as
                    from John Fawcett and Nancy Smith. His report explained the scope of tape
                    recorded Presidential documenation for the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and
                    Nixon administrations, their actual and potential use for the <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> series, and the problems of
                    access.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked whether the j attachments to the report were created specially for
                    Herschler’s report, or are they finding aids? Fawcett replied that all the
                    documents are available to researchers; Herschler concurred, but explained that
                    a one-page list provided by the Eisenhower Library had been annotated for the
                    report.</p>
                <p>Kimball inquired about donor restrictions to LBJ’s telephone conversations. They
                    are very important. Can the Committee do anything to get LBJ Library Director
                    Harry Middleton and Mrs. Johnson to accelerate the opening of the materials?
                    Nelson remarked that another problem was the time involved in making available
                    3,000 conversations. Herschler noted that many of the conversations relating to
                    foreign relations can be identified from the Daily Diary. The LBJ Library is
                    also working on an inventory of recorded meetings during 1968.</p>
                <p>Fawcett then explained the problem of the donor’s deed of gift, with its 50 year
                    restriction. Middleton understands the intent here, and the gift can be altered.
                    He hopes he can solve the problem and that they can be opened by the year 2000.
                    In response to a query by Nelson, Fawcett indicated that the Committee cannot do
                    much except write a letter to Middleton. The problem is not Mrs. Johnson, who is
                    agreeable to opening them. The problem is that these phone calls were taped
                    without the consent of the other party (there would have been no confidential
                    advice given to LBJ if they had known their conversations with the President
                    were being taped), but some still active in public life can be damaged by what
                    was then said. He thinks Middleton is struggling with this question and can
                    solve it.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked whether Middleton understood PA/HO’s requirement to publish the
                    Johnson foreign policy record by 1998. Fawcett conceded that the timing for <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> might be difficult, but pointed out
                    that the Kennedy record had <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0030"/> been
                    compiled without including much of the JFK recordings. He also indicated that
                    most of the recorded LBJ meetings were covered by paper documentation. The
                    difficulty for the tapes was they have to be used with extreme care. Although
                    the NSC has agreed to a procedure to review the tapes for declassification, the
                    National Security Archive is swamping the NSC with requests (every document in
                    the Richey case). Professional historians are losing out. Experts detailed from
                    agencies to the NSC will be eliminated at the White House as part of President
                    Clinton’s cuts.</p>
                <p>Kimball then asked how important these conversations are to PA/HO’s research.
                    Herschler replied that David Humphrey has said that they are very important for
                    understanding the Johnson presidency. Kimball agreed, indicating his belief that
                    Johnson was “a telephone man.” Nancy Smith suggested that perhaps PA/HO could
                    pinpoint specific recorded meetings on specific topics, and Kimball agreed that
                    it would be a good idea if PA/HO compiled such a list. Herschler noted that many
                    are transcribed but archivists cannot verify the accuracy of the
                    transcriptions.</p>
                <p>Glad inquired whether PA/HO historians could not even look at the transcripts.
                    Kimball and Fawcett both noted that they are government property but not
                    government documents.</p>
                <p>Kimball stated that access by 2000 would not be adequate to meet PA/HO’s research
                    needs. He asked when Middleton might retire or if someone in Washington should
                    have the authority to make the access decision on the Johnson tapes. Fawcett
                    reiterated that Middleton was the key person in accelerating access. Kimball
                    asserted that PA/HO should try to get access to the recordings and transcripts
                    as part of the current research and compilation process, even if the compilers
                    could not publish the transcripts when the volumes go to print. Fawcett agreed
                    that the tapes Would assist in helping PA/HO’s research. They will provide a
                    guide in the selection process. Kimball echoed, “good point” (3 times).</p>
                <p>Perkins inquired whether it might be possible to transcribe the conversations not
                    already transcribed and to get earlier access to the transcripts than the
                    recordings. Fawcett explained that it is misleading to believe that the
                    transcripts are the same as the tapes. For the Kennedy presidency, for example,
                    one transcript was just wrong, with one person (LBJ) left out of the transcript
                    completely.</p>
                <p>From his reading of the report, Perkins questioned the explanation of why PA/HO
                    did not look further into the closed recordings at the Kennedy Library.
                    Herschler responded that Suzanne Forbes emphasized the resource limitations at
                    the Kennedy Library. In arranging for PA/HO historians’ access to <pb n="31"
                        xml:id="pg_31" facs="0031"/> library materials, she provided a general
                    caveat that additional resources was required. Also, the quality of the tapes
                    and time involved in listening to and deciphering them were factors. Fawcett
                    pointed out that it is difficult to identify the voices on the tapes because
                    people talk over one another, for example. Special training is required to
                    listen to these tapes intelligently.</p>
                <p>Perkins inquired whether it is correct that there are no donor restrictions to
                    the Kennedy recordings for PA/HO. Herschler concurred, adding that PA/HO would
                    have to get the approval of NSC and perhaps otner agencies, but this was within
                    the realm of standard access requests for Presidential library documentation.
                    Fawcett remarked that Bourke Marshall can stop PA/HO historians from gaining
                    access, but recent newspaper stories suggest he will not. LaFantasie said that
                    PA/HO was trying to decide whether to pursue the tapes, and if so how far it
                    should go. We don’t have answers now, but we are thinking about it for the
                    Kennedy, Johnkon, and Nixon volumes.</p>
                <p>Kimball noted that Fawcett and Smith would be joining the Committee at lunch, and
                    they could explore together the issue of the Nixon tapes. Herring asserted that
                    the tapes could make the series much more exciting and appealing, but he would
                    hate to see the volumes held up for a long time. Smith said the Nixon tapes are
                    very difficult to use. She noted that the Watergate tapes were opened in 1991.
                    One of them without a transcript involved foreign policy. PA/HO could listen to
                    it as a test. Herschler agreed that it would be very difficult to use the tapes
                    without a transcript. Kimball stated that even selective use of the tapes would
                    help the series. Smith reiterated her earlier point about identifying specific
                    tapes relating to foreign policy for use by PA/HO.</p>

                <p>John Fawcett and Nancy Smith of the Office of Presidential Libraries at NARA
                    joined the Committee for its luncheon on Friday, February 19. Toward the end of
                    the luncheon, Fawcett and Smith discussed the availability and accessibility of
                    audio tapes and transcripts for the presidencies of John Kennedy, Lyndon
                    Johnson, and Richard Nixon. In discussing the tape recordings, Fawcett and Smith
                    stressed that reliance on previously prepared transcripts--especially in regard
                    to the Kennedy tapes-- was not prudent, for some of those transcripts were
                    grossly inaccurate and incomplete.</p>
                <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0032"/>
                <p>Regarding the Johnson tapes, which are closed for 50 years by virtue of a donor
                    deed of gift, Fawcett reiterated that Harry Middleton, the Director of the LBJ
                    Library, is trying to find some means of opening the tapes for research.
                    Expanding on his remarks during the previous session of the Committee, Fawcett
                    suggested that the Committee could help to get these materials open by
                    contacting Middleton and expressing strong support for the opening. Beyond that,
                    he said, he wasn’t sure what the Committee could do to change the present status
                    of the Johnson tapes. Committee members pointed out that Middleton had been
                    working a long time on trying to get some of the tapes released, but there had
                    been no results for all the effort. Fawcett suggested that he would be happy to
                    call a meeting with Middleton, Slany, and himself to begin exploring the
                    question of access by Department historians to the Johnson tapes. He also urged
                    PA/HO to use the Daily Diary to identify specific recordings relating to foreign
                    policy to have ready for an access request.</p>
                <p>As for the Nixon papers and tapes, Fawcett explained the unique set of
                    circumstances that govern access to these materials, including court decisions
                    that could preclude access even by government historians. It was Fawcett’s
                    opinion that access by the State Department historians to the Nixon <hi
                        rend="underline">papers</hi> would not be a problem. Gaining access to the
                    tapes, however, would, he thought, be difficult. He explained that Nixon has a
                    right to object to access by anyone, although the law provides for access by
                    U.S. government employees for purposes of conducting official business; he also
                    pointed out that this right will no doubt be passed to Nixon’s heirs after his
                    death. Another aspect complicating access to the tapes is the 27,000 page
                    inventory of taped conversations that has been prepared.</p>
                <p>Later, Fawcett and Smith suggested streamlining and targeting requests for
                    material as specifically as possible, as a way of sampling the recordings rather
                    than trying to jump feet first into the entire ocean of audio tapes. Fawcett
                    feared that recent unauthorized releases of information concerning the content
                    of the tapes (i.e., <hi rend="underline">New Yorker</hi> article) would
                    galvanize Nixon to become even more resistant to allowing any access to the
                    tapes. Fawcett did suggest, however, that Slany contact Nixon’s attorney, R.
                    Stan Mortenson, to begin discussions about access to the Nixon papers and tapes,
                    and especially to the log that would allow PA/HO to identify specific taped
                    conversations relating to U.S. foreign policy.</p>

                <p>The Committee convened at 2:05 p.m. Kimball asked if members of the PA/HO staff
                    had any comments. Patterson asked Kimball to report on the Committee’s luncheon
                    meeting with Fawcett and Smith. Kimball stated that major discussion was on the
                    Nixon tapes and asked what the views of the staff were.</p>
                <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0033"/>
                <p>Keefer indicated that, in general, he felt that records of this sort were too
                    discursive to easily lend themselves to inclusion in <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi>. Patterson suggested that work on these tapes be
                    done last after other records had been researched in order to fill gaps in the
                    available documentation. James Miller noted that certain documented
                    conversations such as the George Ball telecons at times made good footnote
                    material. Herschler pointed out the need for lead time, once general access was
                    obtained, so that LBJ Library staff can review for donor restrictions.</p>
                <p>Herring asserted that it was important to push Middleton in the direction he was
                    leaning to open these tapes up. LaFantasie opined that PA/HO was not really
                    interested in publishing the tapes as documents, but that they could be very
                    useful in annotating published documents or leading PA/HO researchers to
                    important documents that should be published. The Office needed to be specific
                    in requesting access and examining the tapes.</p>
                <p>Kimball suggested that LaFantasie draft a letter to Middleton requesting PA/HO
                    access to Johnson recordings and transcripts to specific conversations. The list
                    of conversations should be attached to the letter, which should be sent to
                    Kimball for comment in draft. Kimball also suggested an early meeting between
                    Slany, Fawcett, and Middleton. He would consider speaking to Middleton
                    directly.</p>
                <p>Van Camp urged that Slany talk with Middleton on this issue, and Slany thought a
                    Kimball visit to the Johnson Library might be useful. The Committee agreed that
                    LaFantasie should draft a letter on access to the Johnson tapes and
                    transcripts.</p>
                <p>Taylor requested staff suggestions regarding procedures for the automatic
                    declassification of records. Patterson responded that agencies be given 6 months
                    to come up with objections to declassification of documents within certain
                    files; otherwise such records should automatically be declassified at 30
                    years.</p>
                <p>Perkins brought up the issue of deletions from the Tibet portion of the 1958-1960
                    China volume. He felt that the preface to this volume should note that a
                    significant part of U.S. policy could not be documented. Glad raised the
                    possibility of further appeals. Schwar reasserted that PA/HO had gotten the most
                    it could from the EAP Bureau on this issue. LaFantasie stated he had sent the
                    volume for printing with this view in mind. The 58-60 China volume was sent for
                    printing during a transitional phase of declassification reform under the
                    legislation.</p>
                <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0034"/>
                <p>The Committee then discussed possible language for the prefaces to volumes that
                    would clarify when materials were unavailable and whether some langauge should
                    indicate that a microform supplement might later contain material currently
                    withheld or cleared after a volume went to press. It was agreed that LaFantasie,
                    Schwar, Perkins, and Glad would consult to work out a satisfactory preface for
                    the China volume.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked if there were any other volumes with which PA/HO had problems with
                    the declassification review. Herschler commented that we had raised some
                    questions and suggestions informally with HDR and the Department, and were
                    getting better results through use of informal clearance procedures in the
                    Department for more recent volumes.</p>
                <p>Nelson and Glad reported on their meeting with the CIA declassification group.
                    Nelson felt they were serious scholars with the intention of releasing what they
                    could. She noted the need to get rid of a “second loop” in declassification
                    procedures -- the directorates. Glad stated that she believed CIA was making a
                    “good faith” effort to begin opening its records. John Pereira was very helpful,
                    and did not appear to be wedded to security interests at the CIA. She had no
                    illusions that progress would be easy, however.</p>
                <p>Glad then outlined the CIA’s declassification process. The Historical Review
                    Group (Pereira’s staff) reviews documents referred to them by HDR, then sends
                    the documents to the originating office in CIA for review with a 30-day time
                    limit. The Historical Review Group also sends a copy of the legislation,
                    requiring justification for withholding information. Documents then go to the
                    Directorates of Intelligence and Operations, where there are still delays in
                    review.</p>
                <p>With regard to the status of volumes under review at the CIA, Glad reported that
                    the 1958-1960 Indonesia appeal was nearly completed. The Historical Review Group
                    had completed its review of 1961-1963 Arms Control with 548 out of 581 documents
                    released in full and only 5 documents denied. Perreira’s staff had withheld only
                    1 document in its review of the 1963-1963 Congo volume. The staff could not
                    report on the Vietnam 1965 volume because it had been reviewed under the old
                    procedures.</p>
                <p>Kimball indicated his concern over the low-risk strategy adopted by CIA in
                    vetting documents to the agency components. That was a bad precedent. Perkins
                    commented that the relationship with CIA was at an early and informal stage and
                    it was difficult to know how it would work out. Slany then explained that under
                    PA/HO’s new role in coordinating declassification of <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> manuscripts with other agencies, PA/HO would submit
                    documentation directly to CIA and could monitor procedures.</p>
                <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0035"/>
                <p>Kimball reported that he and Slany had met with Warren Littrel early Friday
                    morning regarding the creation of a small working group on declassification. He
                    had told Littrel of his concern that the working group could slow down or delay
                    rather than resolve the issue. Littrel understood this, and assured Kimball that
                    Tolson had directed him to solve the problem. As a result of the morning
                    meeting, Kimball said he had confidence that Littrel was not dissimulating and
                    would cooperate. Kimball had proposed that an auction plan be developed for the
                    working group.</p>
                <p>Kimball then reported on a proposed scenario that he, Littrel, and Slany had
                    discussed. The working group would convene early in March and would have 30 days
                    to prepare its recommendations. They had discussed the possibility of the
                    working group being jointly convened by Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Adminsitration Littrel and Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs
                    Boucher. The Department would report to Congress by April 30 with an Action
                    Plan. According to the agreement, about a week to 10 days after the working
                    group completed its task, a senior group with authority to make decisions would
                    convene to address the working group recommendations and move the process
                    forward with the Department, Congress, and any other agencies as necessary.
                    There was still the problem of pending high-level appointments in the Department
                    that could delay this timetable. Hopefully they would be in place in time to
                    give support to the effort. Another key point was that the solution arrived at
                    by the working group had to be resource neutral. In any case Kimball did not
                    think throwing dollars at the declassification problem was a viable solution.
                    Littrel also indicated that solutions should be “low risk” regarding the
                    security of information in the record.</p>
                <p>Kimball reported that the working group would have 1 member from the Committee, 1
                    or 2 each from PA/HO and A/IM, 1 or 2 from other bureaus within State, and 1
                    from NARA. One of the Department members would be from a desk or other
                    operational office. The working group was to come up with practical solutions to
                    meet the mandates in the new legislation. Kimball added he was searching for
                    consensus, not alternative solutions. In addition to the Committee
                    representative on the working group, the full Committee would have an
                    opportunity to review and comment on the recommendations of the working
                    group.</p>
                <p>This led to a discussion of the date of the next meeting of the Committee. The
                    consensus was for early May with Slany to coordinate among the members.</p>
                <p>The meeting adjourned at 3:50 p.m.</p>
