                <head>Open Session, February 17, 1994, 9:10 - 10:25 A.M.</head>
                <p>Chairman Kimball opened the meeting at 9:10 a.m. He introduced and welcomed
                    Melvyn Leffler who replaced Bradford Perkins. Leffler is a professor of American
                    diplomatic history at the University of Virginia and is the new president of
                    SHAFR. Kimball explained the 3-year rotation of new Committee members.</p>
                <p>He asked if the members wanted any changes in the agenda. Herring said he wanted
                    to delay his subcommittee report; Kimball asked Chaddic to be available to hear
                    Herring’s report. Picker said that her report would be incomplete but no delay
                    was necessary. Van Camp confirmed her scheduled time.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked for approval of the minutes. Slany announced that he has received
                    amendments that are not in the text the Committee has. The Committee decided to
                    postpone agreement until the members could review the changes.</p>

                            Freeman</hi></head>
                    <p>DAS Bennett Freeman stated that the <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series has made great progress in the last 2-3 months and
                        the Committee has engaged the attention of both the A and DS Bureaus. A
                        “constructive dialogue” has begun on both the 30-year issue and PRD 29. The
                        December 15 meeting was a “real breakthrough” where both sides expressed
                        their concerns and criticisms. The Committee’s advocacy has made a
                        difference and its views are being taken seriously.</p>
                    <p>Kimball thanked Freeman and asked Slany for his report.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="underline">Report by the Historian, William Z. Slany</hi></head>
                    <p>Slany reported that the 1991-1992 plan is generally being adhered to; more
                        than 18 print volumes and microfiche supplements will be released. The
                        backlog of volumes compiled in the 1980s is being eliminated but the series
                        will probably not meet the the 1996 deadline. Not even all the Eisenhower
                        volumes are cleared.</p>
                    <p>Declassification is a process that we control “least effectively.” He then
                        made reference to a report prepared by David Herschler and staff addressing
                        issues of declassification and its problems, which had been given to
                        Committee members earlier. The bottleneck, which is not within the State
                        Department but at other agencies, has gotten worse since last November; only
                        one volume has been cleared in the last five months. 15-18 volumes are being
                        delayed. Assistant Secretary Donilon has addressed a letter to CIA Executive
                        Secretary Hazlewood who has responded. But Slany made it clear that the CIA
                        has failed to address <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        declassification problems. In fact, no one from CIA will be at the meeting
                        today.</p>
                    <p>Slany noted that Pereira differs with HO on the number of volumes cleared and
                        uncleared. We have communicated our problems to CIA and Pereira has said
                        that he would have 40 people by late spring. But the delay continues and
                        each delay drives further delays. The process is so complicated that even if
                        CIA clears 15-18 volumes, HO couldn’t publish the necessary number of
                        volumes this fiscal year because of further necessary clearances at NSC
                        (which has a small clearance staff). He could not tell the Committee with
                        “candor” that the 1994 schedule can be met.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0007"/>
                    <p>Slany said the PA Bureau leadership has supported the Office. Maybe HO can
                        make up the 1994 shortfall in 1995 in order to meet the schedule. He noted
                        that a paper in the briefing package delineated these problems.</p>
                    <p>Kimball asked if the CIA had responded to the letter. Slany said that they
                        had replied and acknowledged the predicament. The Committee read the letter,
                        and Nelson noted it was a “non-answer.” Slany said that in a conversation he
                        had with Pereira, Pereira said the CIA was assigning more resources to <hi
                            rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> and in the future more <hi
                            rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes would be cleared.</p>
                    <p>Herring asked if now was the time for the Committee to take action. Kimball
                        said yes. Glad noted that the letter made no mention of new declassification
                        standards. Slany said no, they were using the old standards. She asked if
                        they were willing to release the word “covert.” Slany replied they the
                        agency had not altered their position on CIA involvement.</p>
                    <p>Nelson said that having so many levels of clearance and requiring referral of
                        documents to many agencies was an involved way to declassify documents.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg asked if it were possible to get Pereira to appear before the
                        Committee. Kimball asked for Committee approval for him to call David Griese
                        to have someone come from the CIA to discuss this problem and explain CIA’s
                        delay. If no one will come, the Committee should draw up a formal response.
                        All agreed and discussion of this was postponed.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0008"/>
                    <p>Chaddic asked if he could make a brief report. HDR has begun to seek Bureau
                        clearance at the end of State’s 120-day period rather than at the end of the
                        NSC clearance period. But he needs to know when and what volumes will be
                        coming to his office so he can schedule a reviewer. Kimball said the
                        Committee agreed at its last meeting that effective, realistic schedules are
                        essential for both HDR and HO.</p>
                    <p>After reviewing Herschler’s summary report on declassification (Section H)
                        Kimball noted an interesting problem. Herschler was candid about problems in
                        and out of HO. He asked if the Committee could hear more about the problem.
                        Herschler explained the process of re-review at HO request. In the case of
                        the 1958-1960 volume on national security policy, however, HDR initiated a
                        complete re-review of the manuscript, resulting in additional releases and
                        referrals to other agencies. He wants HDR to consult with HO before such
                        referrals.</p>
                    <p>Pryor said that this re-review occurred for that volume and for the 1965
                        Vietnam volume. When the reviewer died and HDR reviewed his files, it
                        noticed that a lot of material was releasable, especially concerning
                        U.S.-Soviet relations (the initial review had begun in the mid-1980s). HDR
                        has a responsibility to release Department of State material and to make the
                        releases consistent. This will not be a routine procedure, but HDR has this
                        responsibility, especially if there is a sudden change in the parameters of
                        U.S. foreign policy that allows material to be released.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0009"/>
                    <p>Kimball pointed out that the Committee has a dilemma: quality versus sticking
                        to the schedule, in both of which the Committee is interested. “We never
                        want quality to disappear.”</p>
                    <p>Van Camp said that Herschler was asking for consultation so HO could weigh
                        the factors and make a decision. Kimball and Rosenberg stated that the
                        re-review would not likely happen again. Chaddic pointed out that it
                        shouldn’t happen under the 120-day time limit.</p>
                    <p>Nelson noted that HDR is willing to change its procedures but CIA is not.</p>
                    <p>Picker asked Pryor how many documents had been released from the re-review.
                        Pryor said about 50-60 documents in each volume.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg asked for an explanation of the CIA “paperwork” delays. Herschler
                        explained that delay occurred between the office that does the review and
                        the office that logs out documents and writes the response to HO.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg next asked about “late referrals.” Herschler explained that this
                        involved documents newly compiled or documents recently identified.
                        LaFantasie added that these documents were the result of new research.
                        Herring asked if this new research was occurring across the board for all
                        volumes. LaFantasie told him that the new research was being done
                        selectively at the CIA and at the Johnson Library.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0010"/>
                    <p>Rosenberg said it was too bad about the slippage in the schedule but she
                        applauded the new research and the new documents. LaFantasie pointed out
                        that HO needs to maintain the schedule because the law is definitive.</p>
                    <p>Glad asked if the supplemental documents would be released later. Kimball
                        said that HO is investigating if there are a sufficient number of documents
                        available for Iran and Guatemala supplements. Slany said that HO is
                        investigating the feasibility. Slany and Kimball both expressed concern that
                        the agencies would delay declassification because the documents could be
                        published at a later date in a supplement.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg asked about the covert activities supplemental volume. Kimball
                        asked if we should ask CIA to give specific goals and schedules.</p>
                    <p>Taylor asked, regarding the review and release of additional information, if
                        NARA would have the new material. Pryor and Chaddic said that NARA would but
                        it would only be released after a request for re-review.</p>
                    <p>Kimball said that this issue, re-review of 1950s material after 30 years and
                        the FOIA overload, should be on the agenda for the Committee’s next
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>In completing his report, Slany touched on the process the Historical Office
                        was going through to recruit four professionals and a few support staff. The
                        Office has been given permission to hire from outside the State Department
                        but those people will have to go through the 6-month clearance process. The
                        Department has given the Bureau money to publish these volumes; the failure
                        to publish is not for lack of money.</p>

                    <p>Kimball noted that the questions raised at the last meeting are on the
                        agenda.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg commented that the Dominican crisis should not have a whole volume;
                        we should not let military activity dictate <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> coverage. Keefer explained that the volume will cover the
                        Dominican crisis, Cuba, and the Caribbean; another volume will cover all
                        other Latin American subjects. The Office was committed to only two volumes
                        on Latin America but they will both be more than 800 pages.</p>
                    <p>Kimball wanted to add this issue to the agenda for the next meeting:
                        comprehensiveness in fewer pages (for the Johnson volumes). Kimball asked
                        for the Perkins chart, which was distributed.</p>

                    <p>Next Nelson gave the report of the Rosenberg/Nelson/Taylor subcommittee. They
                        went to Suitland to review the State declassification process. The
                        subcommittee met with Marvin Russell (NARA) and William Hamilton (HDR). She
                        reported that 221 boxes had been completed by January, but there was no way
                        that the 30-year deadline of 1996 can be met.</p>
                    <p>State was working hard on the 1961-1963 Central files, which would be ready
                        by 1996, and NARA was working on the Lot and Post files. The process for the
                        1964-1966 records was more problematic. HDR is just beginning to draw up
                        guidelines; State could get through the Central files, but NARA could not
                        complete the Lot and Post files.</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0012"/>
                    <p>The subcommittee was alarmed at the 1964-1966 period. HDR was doing the
                        Central files; NARA was doing the Lot and Post files in a single review. The
                        sheer volume of files was unbelievable. Langbart pointed out that the
                        1964-1966 Lot and Post files were still in the custody of State, but
                        Rosenberg affirmed that the division of labor between State and NARA will
                        remain.</p>
                    <p>Nelson said the subcommittee had a critical meeting with the declassifiers
                        and asked how the Committee could sample the process and why the process was
                        going faster. The subcommittee learned that the process was faster because
                        declassifiers now had a one-stage process and there were more people. It was
                        also clear that they had a different mindset to go quickly through
                        non-sensitive material.</p>
                    <p>Regarding sampling, the subcommittee learned that each box has a folder with
                        withdrawal slips. These withdrawal slips could give the Committee a way to
                        sample the declassification process. One box had 150 withdrawals, all of
                        which were documents with CIA equity.</p>
                    <p>Nelson also reported that this is a subjective process, and each document
                        must be read for code words and sensitive words. She commented on the
                        benefit of discussions among the State reviewers to agree on interpretation
                        of texts. Kimball said the Committee must have the same interchange of ideas
                        with NARA.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg said that the reviewers estimate that up to 80 percent of tabbed
                        (withdrawn) material was CIA equity. The CIA response to a written message
                        for a CIA reviewer <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0013"/> was
                        non-committal. The Committee should urge CIA to provide a reviewer to speed
                        the process. Even if a CIA reviewer is present, however, unless the CIA
                        changes its guidelines, he/she might not be the panacea we all think.</p>
                    <p>Smith commented that if the 1964-1966 Lot files were transferred to NARA
                        before the compilers could do their research, the compilation of volumes
                        would be slowed.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg asked if anyone were taking responsibility for the 1964-1966 Lot
                        and Post files. Kurtz said that NARA is dealing with the 1961-1963 records
                        first.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg said that the subcommittee had also learned that there is no money
                        in the State budget to pay the annuitants in HDR; this would stop the
                        process by March</p>
                    <p>1. HDR felt very threatened. Nelson asked if the Committee could help.</p>

                <p>At 10:50 a.m. the meeting resumed, and Kimball reminded speakers to speak up, and
                    asked them to make it clear if the discussion is classified. He noted that the
                    fact that a session was closed did not necessarily mean that it was
                    classified.</p>

                        Order</hi></head>
                    <p>Kimball then introduced John Hancock from the Diplomatic Security (DS)
                        Bureau, who was there to discuss the draft executive orders on
                        classification/ declassification. He reminded the Advisory Committee that
                        Assistant Secretaries Quainton and Kennedy were also going to discuss these
                        issues during the working luncheon.</p>
                    <p>Hancock began by saying that he was representing DS and noted that he had a
                        longstanding involvement with declassification and the rules governing
                        declassification. He reminded the Committee that PRD 29 had directed that
                        the current executive order be revised and made relevant to the
                        post-cold-war world.</p>
                    <p>In order to come up with a draft executive order, Steve Garfinkel, ISOO, had
                        convened a task force with representatives from 20-odd agencies, on which he
                        (Hancock) and Michael Kurtz from the National Archives (NARA) had both
                        served.</p>
                    <p>Seven different task force committees had studied various
                        classification/declassification issues such as levels of classification, how
                        long material should remain classified, safeguards, and special access. The
                        first draft executive order had come out in August 1993. Following extensive
                        comments, it had been revised. The second draft order had come out on
                        November 10, but Garfinkel had made it clear that this did not reflect a
                        consensus. Since November, the draft order has been with the NSC staff.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out by Hancock that the Department of State had worked very
                        closely with the Advisory Committee <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0015"/>
                        during this process, and noted that the Committee had said that they might
                        use FRUS as a model because the systematic review procedures had been very
                        successful. There had been a meeting with four Advisory Committee members in
                        December 1993 which had resulted in a memorandum from Kimball in January
                        1994 expressing some of the Committee’s concerns with the draft order. These
                        concerns had been raised with the NSC staff and with Under Secretary
                        Moose.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, the NSC staff was waiting for an evaluation of the draft by
                        the Joint Security Commission, which was looking at all aspects of
                        information security. The JSC report was supposed to have been issued on
                        February 1 and was now scheduled for February 28. The Department of State
                        would look very closely at this report.</p>
                    <p>Discussing the possibility of automatic declassification, at 6, 10, and 15
                        years, Hancock declared that without up-front exception the Department would
                        have to review the documents.</p>
                    <p>Several Advisory Committee members pointed out that this meant that
                        declassification would not be automatic. Hancock said that--in
                        practice--documents would have to be reviewed to see if they contained
                        information that should remain classified. Anna Nelson commented that this
                        meant systematic review.</p>
                    <p>Page Miller noted that there was a language problem here. There was no
                        “drop-dead date” in the draft order if the documents had to be reviewed.
                        Emily Rosenberg asked what dates were being considered for automatic
                        declassification. Hancock said that he was not sure but perhaps 10 and 25
                        years, and pointed out that this would constitute a serious problem for the
                        Department depending on what up-front exceptions would be authorized.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0016"/>
                    <p>George Herring asked what was likely to happen after February 28. Hancock
                        replied that the NSC staff might put its report out for executive branch
                        comments. Betty Glad asked whether the Advisory Committee would be able to
                        comment on the final draft. Hancock replied that it would. Rosenberg noted
                        that they would continue to discuss this during the working luncheon.</p>
                    <p>Melvyn Leffler asked which specific FRUS procedures would be desirable.
                        Hancock replied that the Department with its current resources had been very
                        successful with the current FRUS timeframe; 97% of the material reviewed had
                        been declassified. Earlier reviews at 6, 10, and 15 years would be more
                        expensive and far fewer documents would be released at the earlier
                        dates.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg pointed out that the lack of deadlines in the draft executive order
                        were a problem for the Advisory Committee and suggested that the FRUS
                        legislation might be a better model.</p>
                    <p>Kimball said that in response to a note from Bennett Freeman suggesting that
                        FRUS be used as a model, he had sent a reply agreeing that there were
                        certain aspects of the FRUS legislation that could be used as a model (such
                        as the oversight committee), but pointing out that the Advisory Committee
                        was not sure that the Department of State system was working as it should be
                        and noting that it had unequivocally endorsed systematic review at 20 years
                        and automatic declassification at 30 years.</p>
                    <p>Arnold Taylor asked whether the draft order discussed reclassification.
                        Kimball noted that there were two kinds of reclassification--inadvertent
                        disclosure and documents <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0017"/> that had
                        been officially declassified. Concerning the first, the Advisory Committee
                        was not sure, but it was absolutely opposed to reclassification in the
                        second. He personally thought that it was stupid to reclassify even in the
                        first instance, and noted that the Advisory Committee had suggested
                        different language for the draft order.</p>
                    <p>Hancock commented that he did not remember the exact language, but he
                        remembered that the Advisory Committee was not happy with it. After hearing
                        that several Committee members did not have a copy of the November 10 draft,
                        Hancock offered to provide them with copies.</p>
                    <p>Michael Kurtz of NARA informed the Advisory Committee that NARA had been
                        working closely with the Department of State and said that he was there to
                        report on what had been accomplished. 1.3 million pages from 1961-1963 had
                        been opened for research, and NARA had also opened 1.3 million pages from
                        the pre-1960 lot files. Kurtz said that NARA expected to complete its own
                        work on review of the material through 1963 by April 1, but noted that there
                        were serious concerns and serious budget problems.</p>
                    <p>NARA had been receiving Department of State financial support for
                        declassification, but it was not clear whether this would continue. If it
                        did not, it was questionable whether NARA would be able to follow-up on its
                        previous Department of State work. He had met with Frank Machak to discuss
                        what could be done. Kurtz noted that NARA was planning to integrate the
                        1964-1966 lot files into its move to Archives II in September 1994.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0018"/>
                    <p>Rosenberg commented that when they talked about “finishing the job by 1996,”
                        “job” seemed to mean 1961-1963 and not 1964-1966 and Kurtz replied yes.
                        Kimball said that there seemed to be two solutions--more money and fewer
                        declassification restrictions.</p>
                    <p>Taylor asked how long it would be before the files would be available. Kurtz
                        responded that NARA would try to make them available as soon as possible.
                        Kimball asked how the Advisory Committee could find out which lot files were
                        not yet open. Kurtz said that NARA would provide a list.</p>
                    <p>Herring asked how NARA decided which lot files to process. Jean Schauble
                        replied that some of this was researcher-driven. Nelson noted there was
                        already a list of priorities for lot files drawn up by some SHAFR members.
                        Miller pointed out that all of the files on that list were now open.
                        Schauble said that NARA would provide the Committee with the newest list of
                        what lot files had been opened.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg wanted to know whether the declassification process had now become
                        a single-staff reviewing process, and Schauble replied that it had.
                        Rosenberg asked whether this meant that HDR no longer came by to re-review
                        documents. Schauble said that this had not been done for years except for
                        special issues or cases.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0019"/>
                    <p>Kurtz said that he wanted to develop a companion draft executive order
                        concerning NARA holdings appropriate for bulk declassification with a list
                        of these divided into pre-1945 files (with 22 million pages still
                        classified) and post-1945 files. Kurtz and Joe Chaddic agreed there would be
                        cooperation and consultation between NARA and the Department of State.
                        Kimball stated that the Advisory Committee clearly endorsed this.</p>
                    <p>Nelson commented that it was remarkable that so many pages had been
                        processed, but reminded the Advisory Committee of its (1991?) report stating
                        that NARA would have to do 10 million pages a year.</p>
                    <p>Chaddic said that there seemed to be some confusion concerning the 1964-1966
                        record block. He felt that the Department was on track and he did not intend
                        to have a division of labor with NARA. His staff would do the entire process
                        and give NARA a shelf-ready product. He noted that HDR did not have space.
                        His personal office had been turned into a systematic review space and Ken
                        Rossman’s office had become a repository.</p>
                    <p>However, the first stage of HDR’s move to new quarters was scheduled to begin
                        in mid-March. Chaddic said that his target date for 1964-1966 was still the
                        end of 1996. He noted that John Pereira of CIA had been very positive in his
                        response to HDR and he (Chaddic) expected the HDR-CIA relationship to be
                        very fruitful. Chaddic added that he was very well aware of the HO
                        compilers’ problems.</p>
                    <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0020"/>
                    <p>In response to previously expressed concerns about the WAE payroll problem,
                        Chaddic told the Advisory Committee that the Department of State did not
                        intend to end the systematic review process. The question was whether
                        current employees could replace retired annuitants. He said that HDR could
                        use current employees if they were able to work for at least six months, but
                        noted that there would not be total replacement. He would have to keep
                        1/4-1/3 of his staff.</p>
                    <p>Officers assigned to HDR should be able to speak for the bureaus (and not
                        just refer documents), which would save declassification time. He told Kurtz
                        that HDR had not yet received NARA’s request for a subvention.</p>

                    <p>Kimball pointed out that Chaddic would be here in the afternoon but that Page
                        Miller would not and she had issues to raise.</p>
                    <p>Miller said that she had sent the Committee some material relating to
                        documents on the Berlin crisis which were open in the PRO but not here.
                        Noting that there were 78 Berlin documents not open at the National
                        Archives, she said that she had received from Bill Burr of the National
                        Security Archive specific documents on the Berlin crisis open in other
                        national archives but not in the United States. Some of these had been
                        opened as early as 1982. Charles Sampson commented that 78 documents out of
                        thousands was not that significant. He pointed out that only four of these
                        had been completely denied; the rest had excisions.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0021"/>
                    <p>Slany responded that HO tried to include recently declassified documents if
                        possible, and pointed out that such problems were much less likely to occur
                        now that FRUS volumes were prepared in a year as compared with the old days
                        when years elapsed. Nelson said that she also saw this as an illustration of
                        our FGI problem, i.e., we are very restrictive and other governments seem to
                        worry less. The meeting was then adjourned for lunch.</p>

                <head>Luncheon Meeting, February 17, 1994</head>
                <p>Anthony C. E. Quainton, Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, and Patrick
                    F. Kennedy, Assistant Secretary for Administration, joined the Committee for its
                    working luncheon on February 17, at 12 noon.</p>
                <p>The initial conversation was informal and involved briefing the secretaries on
                    general aspects of declassification in the government, including pre-1950
                    documents still held under classification restrictions.</p>
                <p>Professor Kimball moved the discussion to more immediate concerns of the
                    Committee, namely the current status of the Department action plan. He stated
                    that it was an expectation of the Committee that agencies would be informed and
                    warned by the Department that records were about to be declassified, and that if
                    the other agencies did not respond by sending reviewers to inspect the documents
                    for clearance problems, then the Department should move forward, assume that the
                    other agencies had given a silent approbation, and declassify the records in
                    question. This approach, said Professor Kimball, has not been undertaken, and he
                    pointed out that Joe Chaddic and Frank Machak seem unwilling to implement
                    it.</p>
                <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0022"/>
                <p>The Committee, in general, suggested to the secretaries that it would be useful
                    if desk officers could be briefed on the <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> statute, the deadlines it establishes for declassification,
                    and on the spirit of openness that President Clinton has initiated. Mr. Quainton
                    replied that, from his experience, desk officers seem to be fully aware of the
                    President’s desires, but he suggested that the Committee might want to send a
                    letter to the Secretary of State to request a briefing program for desk
                    officers.</p>
                <p>Professor Kimball brought up the matter of PRD 29 and the draft executive order,
                    mentioning a recent letter from Bennett Freeman and some points that he made in
                    reply. Professor Kimball wanted to stress to Messrs. Quainton and Kennedy that
                    although the Committee supports the idea of automatic declassification at the
                    30-year mark and a 20-year systematic review timetable, the Committee firmly
                    believes that the State Department approach to declassification, established by
                    the action plan, has not set an acceptable standard that should be used as the
                    foundation for a re-drafting of a new executive order. He pointed out that there
                    may be some very worthy elements in the State system that are worth emulating,
                    but there should not be a blanket transfer of the State system into the core
                    elements of the new executive order on classification and declassification.</p>
                <p>Mr. Quainton expressed the view that the outcome of the recent meeting on
                    December 15 with principals from Public Affairs, Administration, and Diplomatic
                    Security, along with members of the Advisory Committee, was general <pb n="23"
                        xml:id="pg_23" facs="0023"/> agreement that the <hi rend="underline"
                        >FRUS</hi> approach could serve as a useful model for the new draft
                    executive order and that this approach would lead to the release of substantial
                    quantities of documents. He reported that the Under Secretary for Management had
                    taken this up with the NSC, and had discussed the possibility of incorporating
                    elements of the <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi> approach into a new draft of the
                    executive order.</p>
                <p>Mr. Kennedy asserted that the Department would like to work with the Advisory
                    Committee and the NSC to establish an executive order with deadlines and with
                    some form of independent oversight. Because of limited resources, he said, we
                    want to use a system that will deliver maximum results. The Committee agreed,
                    and also pointed out that automatic declassification is cost effective for
                    limited resources.</p>
                <p>Professor Kimball returned to some of the specifics concerning the process of
                    declassification, and emphasized that risk assessment should be used as a
                    procedure to facilitate declassification. It could also be used to advantage in
                    the new executive order, he said, just as it was also a feature of the
                    Department action plan (although it has not been implemented by the
                    Department).</p>
                <p>Professor Kimball stated that until risk assessment is implemented by the
                    Department, the Committee could not endorse any draft executive order containing
                    an element of risk assessment. Mr. Kennedy assured the Committee that the
                    Department is not against risk assessment. He stated that it would be very
                    worthwhile for risk assessment to be written into the new executive order,
                    because then it would make sure that it would be enforced. Mr. Kennedy <pb
                        n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0024"/> said that it would also be helpful if
                    the Committee could scrutinize some other agencies beside the Department and
                    offer their critique of other agency responses to declassification and to PRD
                    29.</p>
                <p>Mr. Kennedy said that the Department was actively engaged in working to get a new
                    draft executive order from the NSC. The Committee, upon hearing this, asked Mr.
                    Kennedy if it would be possible for the Committee to see this new draft as soon
                    as the Department receives it. Mr. Kennedy said he would make sure of it,
                    although he pointed out that the Department might reject itself any draft coming
                    back from the NSC that did not measure up.</p>
                <p>Mr. Quainton said that the executive order situation is made even more
                    complicated by the work of the Joint Security Committee, appointed by Secretary
                    of Defense and the DCI, which is supposed to issue its report by the end of
                    February. He said that it appeared this report would recommend a two-tier system
                    of classification: secret (with declassification after 10 years) and secret
                    restricted access (with declassification after 25 years).</p>
                <p>Mr. Kennedy said that the NSC would have to meld the Joint Committee draft and
                    any earlier or revised drafts NSC itself is producing. Mr. Quainton suggested
                    that it might be useful for the Committee to get a briefing directly from the
                    Joint Committee.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the Committee reiterated its position on a new executive order,
                    and stressed that it should include: 1) firm deadlines for both reviews and
                    performance; 2) independent oversight committee; 3) concept of risk assessment
                    together with concept of bulk declassification.</p>
                <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0025"/>
                <p>Professor Kimball underscored that for any approach to work, training must be
                    provided to those who will be implementing the program. This training, he said,
                    was absolutely essential.</p>
                <p>The luncheon was concluded at approximately 1:40 P.M.</p>

                <p>Kimball announced that Pereira of CIA would meet with the Committee at 11:00 a.m.
                    on Friday, and the agenda would be adjusted accordingly.</p>
                <p>Further comments were invited from Chaddic and others by Kimball.</p>
                <p>For the record, Rosenberg wanted to express pleasure at Chaddic’s report
                    regarding the 64-66 record bloc. She felt that the committee should go on record
                    in full support for Chaddic’s center and the need for the Department to give
                    high priority to its need for space and manpower.</p>
                <p>Van Camp noted her concern about the confusion regarding HDR’s and NARA’s roles
                    in declassification of the 64-66 bloc that had been revealed in meetings of
                    Wednesday and this morning, had been resolved.</p>
                <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0026"/>
                <p>Kimball asked Chaddic to explain the question of risk assessment as a preliminary
                    step to bulk opening of the records and how this related to CIA.</p>
                <p>Chaddic gave Kimball a letter from Pereira on this. He stated that the problem
                    related to a particular abbreviation. Pereira says the abbreviation is not
                    classified <hi rend="underline">per se</hi>; it depends on the context. Only CIA
                    can determine whether or not it is classified in a particular context.
                    Approximately 3 documents out of every 100 which are withheld, perhaps 2-1/2
                    could be released if a CIA reviewer could come and make those
                    determinations.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked about CIA documents in older files, noting that the working
                    agreement had called for opening older files by a certain date if CIA did not
                    review it.</p>
                <p>Chaddic replied that too much pressure was counterproductive. He thinks he can
                    get CIA to come and review withheld documents but not to make someone available
                    full-time.</p>
                <p>Kimball commented that this would produce a savings in processing costs;
                    documents which CIA releases don’t have to be wrapped and tabbed.</p>
                <p>Chaddic stated that what they were doing was neither bulk declassification nor
                    line-by-line review but document-by-document review. Many documents can be
                    declassified on the basis of their subject matter.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="underline">Subcommittee Report on Declassification</hi></head>
                    <p>Kimball asked for the Sub-committee report by Herring and Leffler on
                        Declassification Problems.</p>
                    <p>Herring reported on the 1961-1963 British Guiana compilation, which was
                        previously withheld in full. It has now been partially released but has been
                        “completely gutted.” The subcommittee agreed the compilation should not be
                        published in this condition; it would be a “gross distortion.” He observed
                        that it was a fascinating case study, “incredibly revealing,” despite the
                        small size of the country involved.</p>
                    <p>Leffler agreed completely with Herring’s comments. He added that their 45
                        minute meeting with the desk officer proved unproductive. Leffler was
                        concerned that the desk officer seemed to have no sense of obligation to
                        disseminate the public record.</p>
                    <p>He suggested that the Committee appeal to the Secretary to remind Foreign
                        Service Officers (FSOs) of their responsibility of integrity for the series.
                        Chaddic pointed out that the law also required FSOs to protect national
                        security. Leffler thought the FRUS law imposed some obligations on desk
                        officers but agreed that there might be conflicting priorities.</p>
                    <p>Kimball asked if there was any objection to the subcommittee recommendation
                        that HO take the next step in the formal appeal process.</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0028"/>
                    <p>Pryor noted that this was a tough case. The value of the material is evident,
                        but the potential ill effects of its release are also easy to see. Lee
                        Peters, Deputy Director of the Office of Caribbean Affairs, told her
                        informally he would take another look at the files if the subcommittee
                        provides him with comments. He acknowledged that publication with the
                        present excisions would be an incomplete record. She suspected it would be
                        very difficult to close the gap between the Committee and the desk.</p>
                    <p>Kimball asked the subcommittee if they thought further talks would do any
                        good. Pryor saw two areas in which gaps might not be closed: 1) assessment
                        of probable damage to US foreign relations--the task of desk officers; and,
                        2) the issue of what would be acceptable level of damage.</p>
                    <p>Herring felt that the Committee should push forward, if ready to treat this
                        as a test case.</p>
                    <p>Slany noted that the law required HO to try to offer an alternative stating
                        that we could go to the Under Secretary with a compromise. Herring responded
                        that HO could, but Lee Peters would not buy it.</p>
                    <p>Leffler stated that the removal of details about the operation would be
                        acceptable to the subcommittee, but they objected to removal of documents
                        acknowledging consideration of certain activities. Herring thought it would
                        be acceptable if material was included showing the operation was considered
                        and agreed upon, but he did not think the desk would accept this.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0029"/>
                    <p>Herschler noted that many of the documents were now at CIA, 14 documents had
                        to be sent to the UK, and many required NSC review. There was general
                        agreement that this didn’t change the legal responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Slany requested the committee’s advice on what fell into the “operational
                        sphere.” Kimball thought that operational versus policy was a good
                        distinction, but Herschler answered that it was often hard to make those
                        distinctions in reality.</p>
                    <p>George Herring stated that he was prepared to try to make those distinctions.
                        Nelson echoed him that such was the Committee’s job. Kimball believed that
                        the further negotiations would be worth the trouble.</p>
                    <p>The meeting moved forward with the Herring/Leffler subcommittee report on the
                        Tibet documents in the 1958-1960 China volume. LaFantasie explained that CIA
                        had this appeal/new submission for over nine months. The problem is with
                        CIA’s review. CIA has released very little material, but John Pereira says
                        they are willing to take another look, he thinks they can release more.</p>
                    <p>Herschler noted that CIA had publically acknowledged a CIA presence in Tibet,
                        but CIA had denied virtually all the details of particular policies toward
                        Tibet. LaFantasie observed that we don’t have CIA’s justification because
                        there are no markings on the documents and no justifications for its
                        excisions. Herschler also noted that CIA’s response was unofficial.</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0030"/>
                    <p>LaFantasie reported that he had spoken with Pereira about the review and
                        expressed his unhappiness. Pereira told him that CIA was itself compiling
                        additional documents on Tibet and reviewing them. Pereira stated that if
                        given three months (and the expected new resources were in place), the CIA
                        could come up with a very different result.</p>
                    <p>Herschler stated that Pereira’s colleague had indicated that there is still
                        great resistance in the Agency to releasing material on this episode.</p>
                    <p>Betty Glad suggested that minimally CIA should give reasons for its denials
                        and excisions.</p>
                    <p>Kimball noted that Tibet would be the first appeal to an outside agency and
                        wondered if the Department of State would support it. Various committee
                        members commented that the CIA might be considering its own publication
                        program on Tibet and suggested this was a bad precedent for FRUS. Anna
                        Nelson reminded the Committee that CIA publication were sometimes vague on
                        provenance.</p>
                    <p>George Chalou stated that he wondered about the significance of the three
                        month wait and asked if the appointment of a new Deputy Director might
                        somehow change the equation? Lafantasie believed that it might, certainly
                        CIA was holding out that possibility as a portent for improvement.</p>
                    <p>Herring complained that CIA was involved in a “snow job,” noting that he and
                        Gaddis Smith were members of the CIA’s advisory committee which met very
                        infrequently. He was worried about the gap between reality and rhetoric.</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0031"/>
                    <p>Kimball asked for the subcommittee’s recommendation on the Tibet documents.
                        They recommended appeal.</p>
                    <p>Emily Rosenberg suggested that the Committee needed to talk about CIA’s
                        publishing program. While the Committee was delighted with Woolsey’s
                        statement, it was concerned that CIA material be incorporated into FRUS, the
                        official method for publication of U.S. foreign policy. She suggested that
                        this statement should be in their report. Nelson agreed that all CIA
                        material should be available to FRUS. She also stated that the Committee
                        didn’t want to discourage CIA from publishing documents but that FRUS should
                        take priority. Kimball seconded this notion that FRUS is the official record
                        and must take priority.</p>
                    <p>Glad then initiated a discussion of CIA’s special publications which she
                        thought could be useful and certainly provided more detail than FRUS was
                        able to. Kimball seriously questioned the value of the publications, citing
                        the Cuban missile crisis volume as one which he thought too nitty gritty.
                        Leffler thought that the volumes on NIE’s on the Soviet Union were useful
                        and did not believe CIA should be discouraged from publishing.</p>
                    <p>Kimball countered the problem was that CIA special projects, especially the
                        JFK assassination project, became excuses for not reviewing FRUS
                        submissions. LaFantasie pointed out that the Tibet package was only 14
                        documents. Herschler reminded the Committee that most of HO submissions to
                        CIA are small packages of documents.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0032"/>
                    <p>It was agreed by the Committee that CIA must be asked to look at the Tibet
                        documents once again.</p>
                    <p>LaFantasie then suggested that as Tibet was part of a crucial volume on
                        U.S.-China relations 1958-1960, he recommended separating Tibet from China
                        and placing it as a separate compilation at the end of the volume. If CIA
                        released additional material, HO could add it without incurring too much
                        expense and allowing the technical editors to begin work on China. If there
                        was no action by the time the Tibet compilation was to be technically
                        edited, LaFantasie proposed providing a notice to readers that documents
                        were still under appeal and alerting them that if cleared they would be
                        printed as an addendum to the 1961-1963 compilation on China.</p>
                    <p>Herring suggested that this decision should be accompanied by a press
                        release. Nelson remarked that CIA gave wonderful speeches, yet released very
                        little. Kimball suggested that Tibet should proceed to the next step.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="underline">Report from the Picker Subcommittee</hi></head>
                    <p>The committee turned to the Picker subcommittee for its report.</p>
                    <p>Jane Picker gave a long report on her meeting with officials in the Legal
                        Advisers Office about the publications it produces, <hi rend="underline">The
                            Digest of International Law</hi> and the Treaty Series. Picker meet with
                        editor of the <hi rend="underline">Digest</hi> Mary Ann Nash, Assistant
                        Legal Adviser Jamie Selby, and Robert Dalton who was responsible for the
                        Treaty Series. The conversations were awkward and difficult and Picker felt
                        that the Legal Office officials were under the impression that she was
                        meddling in their affairs.</p>
                    <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0033"/>
                    <p>Marian Nash told Picker the day before that she had completed two volumes of
                        the <hi rend="underline">Digest</hi> for 1981-1988. The first was in final
                        pages, but the resources for the production of the second volume were
                        somewhat murky. She had also completed and the Legal Advisers Office had
                        published a cumulative index for the Digest for 1973-1979, but it was out of
                        print. There was a supplemental volume of the <hi rend="underline"
                            >Digest</hi> for 89-90, but there are no plans for publishing beyond
                        1990.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Legal Adviser Selby told Picker that afternoon that Nash’s contract
                        would be terminated. It was not clear whether resources would be forthcoming
                        for Part 2 of the <hi rend="underline">Digest</hi>. Dalton was also present
                        at the meeting with Selby, but the question of continued publication of the
                        U.S. Treaties series never came up. Picker found “unexpected hostility” a
                        surprising change from “diplomats engaging in empty pleasantries.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Claussen suggested that L feared outside interference in internal
                        administration. Picker replied that, as a representative of the American
                        Society of International Law, she would report on her findings at the
                        Society’s annual meeting. Apparently Selby thought the <hi rend="underline"
                            >Digest</hi> would be terminated, but Dalton was not certain. Neither
                        could say how widely the <hi rend="underline">Digest</hi> was used. Dalton
                        said it was mainly used by practicing lawyers; Selby said it was mainly used
                        within L. LEXUS found 200 citations in court cases.</p>
                    <p>Picker suggested that the resources problem might be solved by outside
                        assistance from private donations such as law professors on sabbatical. It
                        was not so much a <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0034"/> matter of
                        resources as use. “Resources” meant time spent collecting and editing, not
                        just funds. Picker thought it was really a question of control.</p>
                    <p>State doesn’t want to publish the <hi rend="underline">Digest</hi> nor does
                        it want anyone else to. State no longer seemed to get the cooperation of
                        other agencies. The <hi rend="underline">Digest</hi> was of value to legal
                        researchers and it would be missed. Picker also noted that she did not get a
                        chance to discuss the fate of the Treaty Series.</p>
                    <p>Picker also got differing responses about the availability of existing
                        volumes; if they were in storage awaiting disposal or recycling. She
                        wondered if they could be made available to law libraries free of
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>Picker mentioned that their files were not centralized; everyone had his or
                        her own. Apparently the 1991 Inspector General’s report recommended
                        discontinuing the Treaty Series. There was no coordination between L and the
                        FRUS series. By way of background, the Department had published five digests
                        of international law since 1908.</p>
                    <p>Since the question of treaty publication had not come up, Glad asked about
                        secret annexes. Picker said these were subject to the same declassification
                        process as other State Department records. Kimball suggested that HO should
                        verify that L/T’s records are indeed in the Central Files. Dr. Slany said
                        that Dalton had not responded to HO’s oral requests for access.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0035"/>
                    <p>Picker lastly brought up the matter of E-mail. She assumed that hard copies
                        were always made. Selby assumed that State abided by the law. Dalton said
                        that he always made hard copies, but could not speak for his colleagues. All
                        in all, her meetings with L had been disappointing. They were not even
                        interested in seeking help from the academic community.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Leffler asked what would be in L/T’s secret files. Dr. Slany said that
                        original texts would be; Ms. Schwar concurred. Mr. Patterson said that L had
                        denied having secret annexes, and had asked HO about them.</p>
                    <p>Kimball said that the Committee had a sense of the problem and found L’s
                        treatment of Picker “insulting.” He asked Picker for a short, punchy,
                        paragraph or page on this issue.</p>
                    <p>The committee recessed for a coffee break at 3:30 p.m.</p>

                <head>Closed Session, February 17, 1994, 3:45 P.M.</head>
                <p>Ms. Van Camp reported on adaptation of modern technology to preservation and
                    eventual publication of the historical foreign affairs record. She, accompanied
                    by Humphrey, met with Rossman of the Records Management Branch on February 16 to
                    discuss the future of record keeping. She said that the meeting served to remind
                    her that the Advisory Committee’s responsibilities include more than
                    declassification and <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>.</p>
                <p>Her report focused on three concerns: (1) record-keeping practices; (2) adequacy
                    of documentation; and, (3) Records scheduling (what is saved).</p>
                <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0036"/>
                <p>Van Camp stated that current policies and guidelines for record keeping must be
                    revised in order to keep pace with the modern means of communication. By 1973
                    the traditional practice of maintaining the Central Foreign Policy File in paper
                    files was replaced by the storage of information in electronic data bases. At
                    that time the State Department began to track information by computer, using an
                    on-line citation index to search for documents stored on either magnetic tape or
                    microfiche. She mentioned the microfiche index to magnetic tape and asked how
                    long these will last, how to declassify them? Van Camp expressed some concern
                    regarding the preservation of, and access to, this information. The Department
                    is involved in an effort to put cable traffic on line back to 1973.</p>
                <p>Anna Nelson asked how documents could be declassified without paper records. Van
                    Camp replied that the declassification issue would certainly be more
                    complicated. Van Camp also explained that the Department was developing a
                    “supercomputer” that would bring all cable traffic on-line, allowing for text
                    searches.</p>
                <p>Van Camp raised the adequacy of documentation issue, citing the potential for
                    information being lost to an electronic filing system. She said that background
                    material assembled in the preparation of an official document might not be
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>Leffler asked if anyone had reviewed the magnetic tapes to confirm the loss of
                    such information. Van Camp replied that it was hard enough to track decisions
                    under the old paper system.</p>
                <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0037"/>
                <p>Van Camp complained that it was difficult to get any attention within the
                    Department on this issues. She suggested that a committee member write an
                    appropriate article for the <hi rend="underline">State</hi> magazine.</p>
                <p>Van Camp moved to the question of how records are scheduled for retirement. She
                    said that the records managers would require consultation from the historical
                    community in order to avoid any unnecessary conflict. Kimball asked whether
                    there was a problem with the disposition of records, and, if so, what the
                    Committee could do to help. Rossman wondered whether the Department should
                    preserve desk officers’ files. Nelson responded that, at least, the lot files
                    are in better shape now than they used to be. Kimball stated that if Rossman had
                    any questions he should bring them to the Committee. Slany then asked whether
                    the Historian’s Office should conduct a periodic review of the issue.</p>
                <p>George Chalou described a National Archives’ initiative to have historians and
                    records managers work together, especially concerning adequacy of documentation.
                    He felt that such efforts are necessary as a means to compare any gaps in the
                    official record with the agency’s records schedule.</p>
                <p>Leffler asked if Rossman saw any problems with the existing system. He suggested
                    that Rossman draft a memo outlining these problems which would allow the
                    Committee to offer some appropriate recommendations. Leffler voiced his great
                    concern if historical evidence might be lost due to the mismanagement of records
                    scheduling. Rossman replied that, while it was not necessarily happening, the
                    potential exists that important documentation could be inadvertently
                    destroyed.</p>
                <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0038"/>
                <p>Rossman explained that some people within the Department think that only the
                    official record needs to be preserved, an attitude which clearly contradicts the
                    Federal Records Act. Rossman indicated the probability that telegrams would not
                    be around by the turn of the century. It could be all E-mail in less than 10
                    years, there will be no central paper files in the Department -- it will not
                    exist.</p>
                <p>Leffler asked Rossman if he knew whether the draft of a speech, for example,
                    would be on magnetic tape. Nelson added that the real problem lay with the kind
                    of documentation usually found within the lot files. Rossman replied that in
                    less than ten years the central files would no longer exist in paper for
                    research. The Department is currently developing a new computer system which
                    would allow the user to search the entire database by text.</p>
                <p>Rossman then told how the development of this computer had been delayed: a
                    $150,000 piece of the system had been damaged when it was dropped in
                    transit.</p>
                <p>Humphrey asked Rossman if the new system would allow for automatic records
                    disposition. Kimball also inquired into the status of the post files. Rossman
                    answered that the lot files were moving toward automation, but that the post
                    files would continue to be retired.</p>
                <p>Jane Picker asked about diplomatic notes. Rossman replied that they were
                    reproduced on microfilm. David Langbart also pointed out that diplomatic notes
                    were considered official documents, and should be fully represented in the
                    central files.</p>
                <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0039"/>
                <p>Ms. Van Camp asked that problems be brought to the attention of the committee and
                    she asked for the help of a historian on her subcommittee. She asked to consult
                    with Mr. Langbart and Mr. Rossman before the next meeting.</p>
                <p>Betty Glad suggested that the Committee coordinate its efforts on this issue with
                    working committees from their constituent professional organizations. She then
                    asked Rossman if it was possible to delete a document electronically, to which
                    the latter replied yes.</p>
                <p>Kimball wondered whether the OAH or AHA were doing anything to address the future
                    of documentation. Rosenberg and Nelson answered that there was some, but not
                    much, interest in the matter. Kimball thought that the Committee members could
                    check with their respective organizations. Rosenberg observed that there was
                    some confusion: which Committee member represents which professional
                    organization? A lively discussion of the confusion ensued.</p>
                <p>George Herring observed that research was moving away from diplomatic history;
                    SHAFR would be most interested. Rosenberg recalled that SHAFR once had a
                    subcommittee; Kimball announced its premature death. Nelson said that in ten
                    years historians would need training in subject searching. Van Camp pointed out
                    that progress was being made. She mentioned that Rossman had been doing a good
                    job; Nelson added Langbart’s name to the honor roll.</p>
                <p>Van Camp cited the recent legal case concerning the Bush White House electronic
                    records. She wondered if historians would actually use E-mail. Kimball wondered
                    if Committee members would actually read their E-mail.</p>
                <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0040"/>
                <p>Kimball asked if Van Camp had anything else to report. Before she could reply,
                    Langbart reminded the Committee that most electronic records are found in
                    databases, and are therefore unlike the records most diplomatic historians are
                    used to.</p>
                <p>Van Camp reported on a Yale University proposal to digitize the entire <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> series. According to a friend
                    involved in document imaging, if the proposal were approved, Yale would
                    establish a Center for the Study of the United Nations and International
                    Relations. As part of the project Yale would convert to digital form not only
                        <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> but also their relevant library
                    and manuscript collections. The system, which would be stored on CD-ROM, would
                    include text-searching and a complete cumulative index. Van Camp explained that
                    the proposal would be part of the Open Book project. She also thought that Yale
                    would need to coordinate their work with HO in order to determine the possible
                    impact of the project on the future of <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                        Relations</hi>.</p>
                <p>Kimball wondered if HO was studying how to adapt to electronic record keeping. He
                    then posed the rhetorical question: “Where are the Luddites when we need them?”
                    Kimball asked Van Camp if Yale had a target date in mind. Van Camp did not think
                    so, but thought that the project could be completed within several years. Slany
                    acknowledged the potential impact of the project on <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                        Relations</hi>, explaining that, in contrast to the current book format,
                    documents would be scanned in image form, including marginalia. Jane Picker
                    wryly offered to loan someone from her over-staffed subcommittee.</p>
                <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0041"/>
                <p>Nelson asked Rossman if there would soon be more information managers than
                    records managers. Information managers, she said, were only interested in
                    today.</p>
                <p>Rossman reported on several recent developments in the disposition of the
                    Department’s records. He said that some classified INR records had been moved to
                    the National Archives. Rossman also recently completed a study concerning the
                    files in the Office of the Legal Adviser; a number of lot files have finally
                    been retired, and a photo collection was transferred to Archives II.</p>
                <p>Rossman then mentioned that he had received a call from an archivist at the
                    Organization of American States, who complained that OAS records were completely
                    disorganized. Kimball wondered how the Committee could help. Slany suggested the
                    possible use of funds from NHPRC. Kimball asked Slany to look into the
                    matter.</p>
                <div type="section" xml:id="lbj-dictabelts_1">
                    <head><hi rend="underline">LBJ Dictabelts</hi></head>
                    <p>David Humphrey reported on the effort at the LBJ Library to process nearly
                        6,000 presidential phone conversations, most of which had never been
                        transcribed from the original recordings. The dictabelt had been donated to
                        the Library with instructions that they remain closed for 50 years.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Middleton tried to open the recordings in 1993, but the Kennedy
                        assassination documents project took precedence. His staff will be on that
                        project until April 15, 1994.The majority of recordings were on dictabelt, a
                        system which was now antiquated, thereby raising preservation concerns. They
                        want to transfer the material from dictabelts to tapes. Humphrey explained
                        that in general <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0042"/> the project was
                        proceeding chronologically, but that the LBJ Library had agreed to assign
                        priority to 375 conversations between Johnson and his foreign policy
                        advisers, Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara, and McGeorge Bundy.</p>
                    <p>This decision was inspired in part by McNamara’s interest in his own
                        conversations for his own prospective memoirs. Humphrey said that the LBJ
                        Library was concerned about the accuracy of the existing transcripts, which
                        did not always match the dictabelt recordings. There are about 400 that have
                        not been transcribed and the tapes should be listened to carefully before
                        publication. The Library also did not know what to expect from the
                        collection; revelations from the recordings, however, had already exceeded
                        their expectations.</p>
                    <p>Rossman interjected that in 1976 he had helped transfer the recordings from
                        Marvin Watson’s California house, a house which subsequently collapsed in
                        the last earthquake.</p>
                    <p>Humphrey raised an important concern: the LBJ Library schedule is not
                        necessarily in line with the <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        schedule. The Library, which has already released the material from 1963,
                        was generally reviewing the dictabelts on a chronological basis. In other
                        words, HO historians might have to wait for access to material, particularly
                        from the second half of the Johnson administration.</p>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0043"/>
                    <p>Humphrey also cited the working conditions on the project, the people
                        involved were tired and had been diverted from their normal duties;
                        consequently their work would probably suffer once the JFK project was
                        finished.</p>
                    <p>He explained that the Department already had a funded position, Charlene
                        Burgess, who is working on the tapes. The Library has proposed that the
                        State Department fund a second person to assist in processing the
                        dictabelts, a two-year project for $60,000. Someone at the NARA has shown an
                        interest in the possible position.</p>
                    <p>Glad asked if the foreign policy breakfast meetings had been captured on
                        tape. Humphrey said that they had not. Glad then stated her conviction that
                        foreign policy related material should take precedence. Humphrey replied
                        that foreign policy discussions are in fact an important part of the
                        collection. Most of the recordings cover the early years of the Johnson
                        administration (1963-1964), and half of these concern foreign policy.
                        Humphrey also thought that transcripts of the recordings were the best way
                        to capture the Johnson style in a <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> volume, since he did not write anything.</p>
                    <p>Kimball asked if the LBJ Library would release the transcripts on an
                        incremental basis. Humphrey said that he was uncertain, but that it probably
                        would. Slany added that he had been told that the Library was inclined to do
                        so.</p>
                    <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0044"/>
                    <p>Herring inquired whether declassification of these materials was likely to be
                        more or less difficult. Slany replied that the archivists would have to
                        create a document where one previously did not exist. Did the Committee
                        think that the Department should spend money to assist in this effort?
                        Nelson said that it was a matter of logistics, balancing the <hi
                            rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> schedule against the
                        transcription schedule.</p>
                    <p>Would these conversations be used to help in the selection of documents or
                        would they be considered documents in their own right? LaFantasie answered
                        that the transcripts could be used in both ways, and that they would help
                        fill an important gap in the record of the Johnson administration. Glad
                        noted that Larry Berman had already shown that the timing of Johnson’s
                        decision to escalate the Vietnam War was not reflected in the paper records,
                        an indication that the transcription of the phone conversations could be
                        very important.</p>
                    <p>Kimball concluded that there seemed to be a general understanding about what
                        needed to be done. He suggested that David Humphrey draft a paragraph for
                        the Committee justifying the funding of an additional position at the LBJ
                        Library. The Committee could then include this language in a letter to the
                        Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>Picker asked if anyone knew why some tapes had been transcribed while others
                        had not. Humphrey replied that no one was sure; in fact, some meaty
                        conversations had not been transcribed. At least, he said, the dictabelts
                        had held up remarkably well.</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0045"/>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned after Kimball gave some brief remarks about the agenda
                        for the following day.</p>

                            Records</hi></head>
                    <p>Using the list of Department of State records provided by Ken Rossman at the
                        November meeting for the committee to use as a tool in developing advice on
                        declassification prioritization, Anna Nelson asked whether the whole
                        committee should comment or just she and Emily Rosenberg. Drawing from her
                        own notes, Nelson mentioned that some lot files (e.g., economic files for
                        1948-1949) might be quickly reviewed and made available for researchers. She
                        and Rosenberg had placed asterisks next to some files on the list that
                        seemed to be critical for historical research.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg said she preferred to defer discussion of the subject until Mel
                        Leffler arrived, and she added that it was not a major agenda item. Warren
                        Kimball commented that the committee was resorting the agenda and was trying
                        to complete some business. He suggested that perhaps the committee could
                        make its suggestions directly to Bill Slany who would sort out “disconnects”
                        over priorities and pass on the prioritized list to Joe Chaddic.</p>
                    <p>Nelson wondered why the committee could not give their lists directly to
                        Chaddic. The committee members would not just agree or disagree but forward
                        some ideas on what should be the important files to be reviewed. Van Camp
                        saw value in coordinating the Committee’s prioritization of records
                        declassification with priorities of FRUS publication. Kimball affirmed the
                        importance of <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0046"/> prioritization, as
                        some records would have no reader demand. Chaddic said he would welcome the
                        committee’s suggestions, believing that emphasis did not need to be placed
                        on prioritization according to FRUS because his staff could review more than
                        one collection at a time.</p>
                    <p>Rosenberg remarked that because the Rossman list was not detailed, it was
                        difficult to tell what was in some of the collections. She would like to
                        investigate further and would like Chaddic to coordinate the suggestions.
                        Langbart noted that the Rossman list included all pre-1964 State records,
                        not all of which had been transferred to NARA or appraised.</p>
                    <p>Kimball concluded that the committee members should give their suggestions to
                        Slany who would pass them on the Chaddic. This took care of an afternoon
                        agenda item.</p>
                    <p>Ken McDonald remarked that only John Pereira, not Gloria Boyd nor David
                        Grease (who was in Miami), would be attending the meeting later in the
                        morning.</p>

                    <p>Slany then called on Steve Kane to give a report on the CIA’s progress on
                        assembling accessible records pertaining to Guatemala. Kane explained that
                        Slany had asked him to report on CIA documentation on Guatemala because some
                        years ago he did the compilations on Guatemala for the 1951, and 1952-1954
                            <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. In looking at the
                        material the CIA had let him sample on Guatemala, he admitted some of it had
                        already been made available to him under the tenure (in the late 1970s) of
                        Jack Pfeiffer as Chief Historian of the CIA. Pfeiffer had tried hard to get
                        these documents declassified, although he was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0047"/>
                    <p>During his recent visit to the CIA, he was told there were about 60 linear
                        feet on Guatemala covering the years 1950-1956. Kane asked CIA historian
                        Gerry Haines to select about a dozen or so feet as representative. Kane said
                        he never saw the manifests, but he looked at agency central cable files, DCI
                        files, files of White House division of operations office and the office of
                        political coordination, psychological strategy documents, and monthly
                        operational parts, especially for 1953-1954.</p>
                    <p>Kane said he found what he expected. In other words, he uncovered no
                        “bombshells” or “smoking guns.” His research both confirmed what historians
                        had speculated earlier and corrected some of their errors (e.g., the size of
                        the budget and number of armed forces). Documentation on the conduct of the
                        operation was substantial and full. High-ranking officials in the United
                        Fruit Company matched with the code number names.</p>
                    <p>It also revealed some internal information on the role of the State
                        Department, although there was high CIA interest in this operation long
                        before such interest surfaced in State. FOIA requests, in particular by
                        (Stephen) Schlesinger and (Stephen) Kinzer, provided a solid basis for the
                        large documentation on this operation. Ken McDonald said that the CIA has
                        plans to declassify this material.</p>
                    <p>In reference to a question asked earlier by Slany as to whether it would be
                        useful to create a supplementary <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        volume, Kane said this was a hard question to answer because he saw only a
                        small part of the total documentation, and so much of it seemed to be on the
                        operational side. This material is not in the published <pb n="48"
                            xml:id="pg_48" facs="0048"/>
                        <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> volume. If the CIA indeed
                        declassified all this material, then the need for a supplementary volume
                        would be moot.</p>
                    <p>Anna Nelson asked if these records could be declassified and released like
                        that on the Cuban missile crisis, i.e., not transferred to the Archives but
                        published. McDonald said his office had no present plans to prepare a
                        supplementary or facsimile edition of the documents on Guatemala.</p>
                    <p>Betty Glad asked where the records came from. McDonald said he would discuss
                        this later. He noted that the job numbers went back to the compiling dates
                        of the late 1970s (Pfeiffer was fired in 1979), and this was a long time
                        frame. Kane said the Historian’s Office fought the battle on
                        declassification for ten years. In 1975 he thought there might be a window
                        of opportunity, but if so, it closed.</p>
                    <p>Nelson considered 60 linear feet to be a lot of records for historical
                        research and said that a finding aid would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>McDonald agreed that there was a lot of material but noted that Nick
                        Cullather, a Leffler student, did the initial search for the files and wrote
                        a classified monograph on the operation. Explanatory material, such as
                        identification of cryptonyms, would help HO historians.</p>
                    <p>Kane assured Nelson that the collection was very well organized and easily
                        used. Also, the study MacDonald spoke of was quite helpful if not as deep as
                        he would have <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0049"/> hoped. Also, in his
                        research, he came across several references to personal diaries which he
                        believes may be able to fill in many gaps in the record currently put forth
                        by this collection. For example, during his first look into this matter in
                        the 1970’s as well as now, he finds much “backchannel” documentation
                        missing.</p>
                    <p>Kimball stated that the Committee feels it has turned up this information
                        (presumably alluding to HO’s recent foray into the INR files).</p>
                    <p>McDonald reminded that everything the State Department will see in these
                        records will not be able to be declassified, and that this might have an
                        effect on whether a supplement is a reasonable expectation.</p>
                    <p>Van Camp asked whether there was an inventory of these records and for
                        clarification on the CIA’s current plans for declassification.</p>
                    <p>McDonald answered that his Historical Staff as well as Pereira’s
                        declassification staff were working on three projects: Iran, Guatemala and
                        the Bay of Pigs. He said he hoped to get the advice of an outside historian
                        to help focus the effort so that gaps are addressed and no “surprises”
                        impede the projects.</p>
                    <p>Herring asked when these projects could be expected to be completed.</p>
                    <p>McDonald suggested Pereira be asked that question, but guessed that Guatemala
                        and Iran should be underway next month.</p>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0050"/>
                    <p>Leffler asked how we knew that this documentation represents everything on
                        this subject. Or have we just asked for what is appropriate? McDonald
                        replied that the documents on the Guatemala episode are well organized
                        because they were earlier assembled for FOIA and a court order (CIA won this
                        case). Nick Cullather also requested more from the directorates. He can’t
                        say everything is available because of compartmentalization at the Agency
                        and some aspects were perhaps never included in the record, but he thought
                        we had almost everything. The files of the early 1950s are not good because
                        the CIA was then expanding rapidly and record keeping was not always keeping
                        up.</p>
                    <p>Leffler asked if the Guatemala collection will be less complete for these
                        reasons than the Iran and Bay of Pigs projects. McDonald answered that the
                        Iran project would be “so-so” and the Bay of Pigs would be better than
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Leffler recalled that in the minutes of the last committee meeting it was
                        mentioned that CIA records are good only during McCone’s tenure as DCI.
                        McDonald said that was misleading. What was meant was that among DCIs only
                        McCone kept detailed records of his meetings, memoranda, etc.</p>
                    <p>Nelson asked Kane about the central cable files. Kane replied that there were
                        two types of cables. The first was marked “central cable files;” the second
                        “Director’s cable files.” He is not sure now what these labels mean; we need
                        to go deeper into it. McDonald said that about 1971 the CIA got rid of
                        central cables after six months; this may not have occurred earlier,
                        however.</p>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0051"/>
                    <p>Rosenberg wondered whether Kane was sure he had seen everything in the State
                        Department files. Perhaps we should look for this material in State records.
                        Kimball said it would probably be in INR, but Ted Keefer said that was not
                        true. The INR records in State do not go back that far, but he did not know
                        where the State records on this subject might be. Kane said that he had
                        interviewed State Department officials, including Bill Krieg, who was
                        stationed in Guatemala, and who made references to backchannel decisions,
                        but he could not find the documents that might confirm these interviews.</p>
                    <p>Jim Miller suggested that the Committee might be attacking this issue from
                        the “wrong angle.” He felt that there were enormous gaps in the documentary
                        record and the finding aids were inadequate. There was also inadequate
                        documentation of the contacts between posts abroad and the desks. This is an
                        ongoing problem, and not limited just to the 1950s. McDonald added that the
                        processing records used in FOI releases were useful in tracing much of the
                        documentation, and that these requests did lead to fairly accurate studies
                        by Schlesinger and Kinzer.</p>
                    <p>Nelson asked what offices administratively preceded INR. Langbart replied
                        that previously there had been two offices. INR was raised to bureau status
                        in 1957, but the documentation is spotty until the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
                    <p>Kimball thanked Kane for his report and called on Harriet Schwar to report on
                        Iran. Schwar began a brief report on Iran by saying that in addition to the
                        handful of documents that had already been reported to the committee, she
                        had heard yesterday from a CIA historian <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52"
                            facs="0052"/> that he had collected about one-and-a-half linear feet of
                        material. She had not yet looked at these documents, although they had come
                        mostly from the Directorate of Operations and seemed to be relevant.
                        McDonald added that he thought this material came from six or so places in
                        the Agency.</p>
                    <p>Leffler asked how these records turned up. Kimball told Leffler that the
                        committee had pursued the Iranian case, which had in fact been a major
                        factor in its creation. He added that the committee had had great difficulty
                        in obtaining any additional material on Iran. McDonald agreed that the CIA
                        had had a problem in locating this material, which was very closely held
                        then, in part because it involved cooperation with the British. British
                        permission would be needed to declassify these records.</p>
                    <p>McDonald noted that British declassification after thirty years totally
                        excludes the British intelligence service. Nothing is released about it, but
                        Kimball wondered whether something had leaked out. Leffler remarked that one
                        British historian (Gaserowski) had gone into this operation in depth.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Schwar said that the newly assembled CIA documents might be
                        potentially important, but she could not make a judgment now. Kimball
                        suggested that the committee defer further discussion on the issue.</p>
                    <p>Slany said that the Historian’s Office would continue to coordinate research
                        on Iran. Kimball agreed. Glad said that full documentation was required;
                        partial documentation and interviews would not be sufficient. Kimball added
                        that access to the INR files was also important.</p>
                    <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0053"/>
                    <p>Rosenberg asked McDonald what is the timetable for completion of the 11
                        covert action projects, and the order in which they would be processed.
                        McDonald said that the CIA will first concentrate on Indonesia, Tibet and
                        the 1954 Italian elections, the so-called “big three.” Glad asked if Eastern
                        Europe in the 1950’s is on the list of 11 covert projects approved by
                        Woolsey. McDonald said “no,” it was not but that such a topic would be worth
                        pursuing. He said that he and John Pereira’s people have identified the
                        records, but do not have a target date. He said it was unrealistic to have a
                        date for declassification.</p>
                    <p>Van Camp asked whether McDonald knew of any international effort to release
                        information regarding Iran. McDonald said “yes,” he thought the British were
                        gradually showing signs of becoming more open about releasing information;
                        for instance, they have publicly acknowledged the existence of the Secret
                        Intelligence Service. McDonald also said that if the Labor Party takes over
                        parliament, we could probably expect even more openness, e.g., U.S.-U.K.
                        material on the OSS.</p>
                    <p>Picker asked if McDonald had any plans to publish more material. McDonald
                        cited several upcoming conferences at which CIA documents will be made
                        public: Truman Conference, 1945-53, 400 pgs., KH4 Corona Reconnaissance
                        Satellite, 1962 (or 1960-65?), 450 pgs, and next fall, a publication of
                        Soviet Estimates, 1950-54.</p>
                    <p>Glad asked what takes priority, <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations of the
                            United States</hi>, or the CIA covert ops studies. McDonald said, most
                        of these documents needed to be reviewed for declassification by the CIA
                        anyway. In <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0054"/> addition, his volumes
                        would be compilations of copies of the documents themselves, rather than
                        printed volumes, and would therefore take much less time without the
                        editing, printing, etc. than the CIA special projects or the <hi
                            rend="underline">FRUS</hi> series. McDonald said the CIA’s Historical
                        Review Group works on declassifying <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi>
                        documents. His office just publishes the documents, they are not annotated
                        like the ones in the <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Kimball said he was very concerned about the clearance of <hi
                            rend="underline">FRUS</hi> documents, specifically how the CIA’s special
                        projects would impact the rate at which <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi>
                        documents would become declassified. He said that in the past when the
                        Advisory Committee had raised the issue of CIA declassifying <hi
                            rend="underline">FRUS</hi> documents, the problem that the CIA raised
                        was one of a lack of resources, yet at the same time the CIA seemingly had
                        the resources to spend time working on special projects. McDonald replied
                        that he was sure that Pereira would say that these 50 to 100 pages will not
                        get in the way, but in actuality, doing State Department work does not get
                        priority over doing CIA work. Kimball expressed amazement that CIA
                        priorities can come over legislation. McDonald responded that CIA’s main job
                        is to produce CIA documents. To choose one duty over the other would hurt
                        both parties, and therefore they are doing both CIA work and State
                        Department work.</p>
                    <p>Glad said that they were not saying that CIA should drop their own work, but
                        rather that they should coordinate, make an effort to work on both types of
                        material. McDonald said that the bottom line is that they are not getting in
                        the way of <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi>. But for the Committee to say that
                        CIA should not do their own studies is a problem.</p>
                    <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0055"/>
                    <p>Kimball remarked that it is of course an issue of resources. The law (22 USC
                        4351 <hi rend="underline">et</hi>
                        <hi rend="underline">seq</hi>.) says that the FRUS series must be on a 30
                        year schedule, and the agencies have 120 days to review documents for
                        declassification. If it is a problem of resources, he questioned whether the
                        CIA studies should take priority.</p>
                    <p>Nelson asked how much time it would take to publish these historical studies
                        as opposed to declassifying the documents and sending them to the Archives.
                        McDonald said that unless a study is being done, they do not declassify
                        collections of documents. Therefore, they would not send the documents to
                        the Archives.</p>
                    <p>Herring asked if these are <hi rend="underline">new</hi> documents for the
                        Truman period. McDonald answered that there are 60-70 new documents, and
                        30-35% have been declassified before.</p>
                    <p>Nelson and McDonald realized that they had misunderstood each other when they
                        had been talking about Archives. Nelson asked if by publishing their
                        studies, CIA was hurting <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi> more than they would
                        by sending documents to Archives. McDonald replied no, if they didn’t have
                        the studies, <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi> would have other problems with
                        the documents going to Archives.</p>
                    <p>Herring asked the status of the JFK project. McDonald said that it was almost
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Smith asked how much of the Pfeiffer collection on Bay of Pigs would be
                        reviewed for release. McDonald replied that if CIA does Bay of Pigs, then
                        others, there could be a problem.</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0056"/>
                    <p>Kimball brought up again the issue that taking the Director’s priorities over
                        legislation is against the law. McDonald responded that the CIA is supposed
                        to be in an era of openness. There are statutes dealing both with the <hi
                            rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> series, and the JFK documents.
                        The JFK project is almost done, and after it is there won’t be a problem
                        unless there are other statutory requirements.</p>
                    <p>Kimball repeated that in the meantime, they are in violation of the law and
                        this is causing the whole <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi> series to be
                        behind. McDonald said they they were only behind on four or five volumes.
                        Kimball replied that this number is misleading. McDonald said that the
                        Strategic Estimates would be out in the Fall. Gates has said that all
                        estimates on the Soviet Union will be out soon, but this is proceeding
                        slowly, and that this is another problem for them.</p>
                    <p>Herschler brought up declassification numbers to discuss with McDonald, but
                        Kimball interrupted saying that we want Pereira and McDonald together for
                        that. He asked if McDonald could stay for when Pereira was here (11:00).
                        McDonald said that he would.</p>
                    <p>The subject turned to attribution of CIA documents.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="underline">Report by Glenn LaFantasie</hi></head>
                    <p>LaFantasie said that he knows that it is an issue for Pereira, but he needed
                        to bring up the subject of provenance. Basically, CIA does not like to
                        publish a source note, but the series calls for one. He stated that he was
                        specifically talking about Job Numbers. We used these in the past as an
                        attribution source. These numbers aren’t really a source, because when
                        documents are at Archives they aren’t grouped by Job Number, however, it is
                        all we have.</p>
                    <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0057"/>
                    <p>LaFantasie continued that we’ve been told that several volumes have been held
                        up in Wright’s office (Director, Information and Privacy at CIA) because Job
                        Numbers are causing them to be held until they decide what to do about them.
                        LaFantasie had promised to suspend using Job Numbers while CIA worked out
                        the issue of provenance with the National Archives in his May 12, 1993
                        letter to Pereira. He said that as far as he could tell, nothing has been
                        worked out yet. Instead, we get response letters from Wright’s office saying
                        thank you for agreeing not to publish Job Numbers.</p>
                    <p>LaFantasie proposed to the committee that Job and Box Numbers be released <hi
                            rend="underline">and</hi> that PA/HO be allowed to create a working
                        group consisting of PA/HO, CIA, and National Archives to work out this
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Nelson said that this sounded like a good solution to her. Langbart
                        interjected that the National Archives can’t tell CIA that they have to let
                        them use Job Numbers, but it would be great to have a method of attribution.
                        He added that Archives cannot determine what this method would be.</p>
                    <p>LaFantasie replied that if the National Archives could give CIA some ideas of
                        what would be a workable type of provenance, it would be helpful. Langbart
                        responded that they have done that, but CIA doesn’t seem to be paying any
                        attention to their suggestions.</p>
                    <p>Van Camp seconded LaFantasie’s recommendation.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0058"/>
                    <p>Chalou spoke up, saying that a Job Number is not a provenance, it is a book
                        keeping device. It has been used on OSS records, to pull them together.
                        Basically, a Job Number at CIA equals a Lot Number at the State
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Herschler asked for clarification of what exactly a Job Number is. McDonald
                        replied that it is a “collection of records as transferred from working
                        records to Archives.” It is CIA’s only way to find collections of records,
                        but then the numbers are changed, so that in the end the numbers are of no
                        use. Leffler asked if Job Numbers are assigned by office. In other words, is
                        one office’s records given it’s own job number? McDonald said that it tends
                        to happen that way, but by definition, no. The shelf list shows what the
                        contents are in a Job Number, but generally the offices do a big dump of
                        their records much like at the State Department.</p>
                    <p>Glad asked why Job Numbers are sensitive. McDonald replied that if a Job
                        Number on a subject gets out, the number of FOIA requests on that subject
                        could become overbearing. Kimball chided that this wasn’t exactly holding to
                        the spirit of the law. McDonald replied that disclosing Job Numbers would
                        also disclose the workings of the inner offices and their names and that is
                        against the law.</p>
                    <p>Leffler pointed out that names of CIA offices are publicly identified in the
                        CIA’s recently published volumes, their administrative histories. McDonald
                        said that these histories were reviewed a while ago, and names of those
                        offices are not sensitive anymore. Leffler said <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59"
                            facs="0059"/> that what McDonald said is that names of offices are out,
                        but they will not let names of offices out, this does not make sense.
                        McDonald said that CIA has the right to withhold names, etc. or to let them
                        out.</p>
                    <p>Leffler asked who at CIA is responsible for provenance. McDonald replied that
                        it is not Pereira or himself. Personally, he does not care about letting Job
                        Numbers out. It is the Directorate for Administration that cares. Leffler
                        again asked who specifically has responsibility. Kimball also asked so that
                        the Committee could address a letter. McDonald said that he does not believe
                        that it needs to be handled that formally. He agrees with LaFantasie’s idea
                        to have a working group on this subject made up of CIA, State and NARA. He
                        added for our information that John P. Dahms is the new Associate Deputy
                        Director of Administrative/Information Service.</p>
                    <p>Kimball said that speaking on behalf of the committee, he endorsed
                        LaFantasie’s two-pronged plan: 1) to resume citing provenance and, 2) to
                        convene the above mentioned working group to resolve the provenance problem.
                        Kimball said that if this approach failed the committee would consider
                        taking the problem to the next level of authority. McDonald said that he
                        thought that this informal working group would be able to solve the
                        provenance problem. McDonald warned that if the informal committee failed to
                        obtain the DCI’s approval, the CIA could potentially “dig in its heels”; he
                        said the CIA if presented with an ultimatum of being forced to accept a
                        provenance solution without its consent would very likely cite its right to
                        withhold information, i.e. bibliographic, and this he said would be a sure
                        way “to get no where.”</p>
                    <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0060"/>
                    <p>LaFantasie emphatically said that his two-pronged approach was not presented
                        as an ultimatum, but rather as an airing of a serious concern on his part as
                        the General Editor to maintain the integrity of the <hi rend="underline"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes.</p>
                    <p>Kimball concluded that he thought the Committee was in agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Committee recessed for a coffee break.</p>

                <head>Closed Session, Friday, February 18, 1994, 11:00 A.M.</head>
                <p>At 11:07 a.m., John Pereira, Director of the Historical Review Group, Central
                    Intelligence Agency, joined the meeting.</p>
                <p>Kimball briefly summarized the Committee’s sense and concern that there is a
                    serious backlog at CIA of <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> material.
                    It has now had an impact on the publications schedule and will have a greater
                    impact in the future. Slany declined to present the problem in more detail; it
                    was OK to address the broad issues.</p>
                <p>Pereira pointed out that there is no one <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> “guru” at CIA; each facet of the review is handled by
                    different directorates. He referred to the (date) letter from CIA Executive
                    Secretary Leo Hazlewood, the intention of which was to inform the State
                    Department that CIA was aware of the law and was committed to processing <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> material but had other demands on
                    its resources. Hazlewood was the Executive Director of the CIA, and no one else
                    in the Agency had as broad a mandate to address this issue as he.</p>
                <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0061"/>
                <p>Pereira recognized that the letter was not adequate, but it reflected an earlier
                    stage. He noted that the Historical Review Group had been established and the
                    number of reviewers had increased from 6 or 7 (with 1 for <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi>) to 20 in 1992 and to 37 by the fall of 1993. This
                    augmentation had been driven by the mandate to review the JFK assassination
                    records and not <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>, but now that the
                    JFK project was drawing to a close, more reviewers are being assigned to <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>. Within the last few weeks, a
                    reviewer is assigned to each volume as it comes into the office. He used as an
                    example the 1965 Vietnam volume: the review was finished in 8 days, and then
                    documents were referred to the appropriate directorates.</p>
                <p>The directorates have small review groups, and he was trying to get the four
                    directors to focus on the <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> project.
                    He hoped to get responses in a few weeks on review of <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> documents and access for State Department historians
                    to CIA records. If the directors agree, it should make a difference in CIA’s
                    responsiveness to the Department of State.</p>
                <p>Kimball referred to the overdue volumes and said that the Committee wanted a
                    “concrete assurance” that the backlog will receive a high enough priority to be
                    eliminated. The Committee would like a firm commitment from the Agency.</p>
                <p>Pereira responded that the Historical Review Group can improve the pace -- 8
                    volumes are in the group, 5 received in the last 4 months. The others are in the
                    directorates. Hazlewood is the person to ask to assign <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"
                        facs="0062"/> resources in the directorates. Jack Wright’s office, which is
                    the administrative side of the process, is committed to getting <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> material logged-in in one week. That
                    staff also has log-out responsibilities. The HRG has also, in the interest of
                    short-cutting the process, given David Herschler unofficial copies of completed
                        <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> reviews at the same time as they
                    went to Jack Wright.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked what can the Committee do. It has legal responsibilities to monitor
                    the process and needs a firm commitment from the CIA to meet target dates.</p>
                <p>Pereira said it was very difficult to provide dates and schedules. He said that
                    the Agency knows that State has target dates under law, but usually such a law
                    has an evaluation process. Kimball pointed out that we are already behind in the
                    target dates, and Congress has been lenient and reasonable. McDonald said
                    Congress could raise the bridge or lower the water, i.e., change deadlines or
                    increase resources. Herschler suggested changing the process in CIA. Pereira
                    pointed out that that was not likely, especially in the directorates, which
                    would have to ask for more money or drop other responsibi1ities.</p>
                <p>Nelson asked if Hazlewood was involved in the consultations with the
                    directorates. Pereira said he is new in the job but is involved and is the
                    decision-maker in this process.</p>
                <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0063"/>
                <p>Nelson asked if the directorates trusted the Historical Review Group to release
                    documents. Pereira explained the process: the HRG judges what to send to the
                    directorates, if the Group disagrees with the directorates’ decisions, then
                    there is discussion and negotiation between them. The HRG can appeal within 30
                    days to the Director of the Center for the Study of Intelligence any review
                    decision. Covert operations is an issue that must be referred to the
                    directorates.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked if the CIA advisory committee could look at the clearance process
                    and make recommendations to move the pace along at a rate that is acceptable. We
                    would like to resolve this at Pereira’s level, but we need a commitment with
                    firm dates.</p>
                <p>Nelson said she understood that the HRG cannot release covert actions and that
                    the material must go the involved directorate. Pereira pointed out that the HRG
                    makes initial decisions about declassification; their reviewers have new
                    guidelines. The problem was in trying to change the mindset of others in the
                    Agency.</p>
                <p>Glad asked about the new guidelines: do they require automatic excision of the
                    word “CIA” and others like it.</p>
                <p>Pereira said that it depends on the document; one case where excision is still
                    required is mention of where a station is (except in a few instances).
                    Information from an agent can be released but the fact that a station exists can
                    still be protected. More judgment is involved and it takes more time.</p>
                <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0064"/>
                <p>Kimball noted that the Committee can only “nibble at the edges” of the CIA
                    process. He asked what the committee can do to solve this problem in an
                    expeditious way. Pereira said to wait for 3-4 weeks for this new initiative to
                    have an effect.</p>
                <p>Herring asked what effect this new initiative will have. Pereira said there will
                    be a speed-up in the process and a higher priority placed on <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>. Kimball asked Pereira if the
                    priority would change in his office. Pereira pointed out that it had already
                    changed.</p>
                <p>Nelson and Glad asked about Wright’s office. Pereira said again that Wright’s
                    office takes care of all the FOIA requests and the bookkeeping part of the <hi
                        rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> reviews. The Department and the
                    Historical Review Group are trying to short-circuit the process at both ends.
                    Herschler agreed, he has been delivering copies directly to HRG at the same time
                    as officially to Wright.</p>
                <p>Glad asked who determined priorities in Wright’s office. Pereira said that
                    Wright’s goal is to get all <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> packages
                    to HRG within 1 week.</p>
                <p>Taylor asked if the speed-up in the process would mean more material was denied.
                    Pereira answered that the HRG is trying to release more and that the
                    directorates have to argue for any material they want to withhold. McDonald
                    pointed out that one way to speed up the process is to deny everything. The HRG
                    is trying to change the focus of the whole agency toward openness.</p>
                <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0065"/>
                <p>Herring asked if the process was slow because there are no people or because of
                    these new negotiations between the HRG and the directorates. Pereira said
                    both.</p>
                <p>Leffler pointed out that in this transition from process to substance, the result
                    is slow but in the long run will be better. In the case of the 1958-1960
                    documents on Tibet, which were returned with no additional releases, he noted
                    the inconsistency between the current public posture of the CIA and its actual
                    practice. Herring agreed that he was “shocked” at the result after he had been
                    led to be more optimistic at the last meeting.</p>
                <p>Pereira said he would also have been shocked. Tibet has been raised to a higher
                    priority, but the Agency had always assumed that the State Department was
                    interested in a top-down approach and would request documents that reflected
                    policy instead of operational details. The directorates were surprised that the
                    State Department wanted to release documents with specific operational
                    details.</p>
                <p>Nelson pointed out that it would be embarrassing if the <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes leave documents out and then the CIA
                    subsequently releases them. Kimball said it’s an issue of credibility. The
                    Committee understood that McDonald and Pereira were doing all they could but
                    they were the only two people in the Agency willing to come to meet with the
                    Committee. But the Committee wants reviews done quickly. Several members of the
                    Committee disagreed, saying that it was more important to get good reviews.
                    Kimball acknowledged it was important to get reviews done expeditiously under
                    new declassification guidelines -- get it done right and well.</p>
                <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0066"/>
                <p>Pereira said that the letter went to the right person, Hazlewood; it set up the
                    problem in the Agency and now CIA is seized of the problem and State should give
                    them a reasonable amount of time to solve it, a minimum of 1 month. Kimball was
                    concerned that the Committee’s silence would lead Hazlewood to believe that the
                    problem is solved. Pereira said no, he didn’t think so.</p>
                <p>Leffler brought up Tibet again. CIA is publicly committed to opening up the case
                    but is denying publication of these documents in the <hi rend="underline"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series. How can the Committee help to break this
                    impasse on Tibet?</p>
                <p>Pereira said the answer is to give us time; this review was returned because of
                    PA/HO deadlines, but the Agency is committed to review and release these
                    documents. This case is part of the initiative to the Deputy Director regarding
                    covert operations. McDonald pointed out that Iran and Guatemala would have to be
                    set aside to review Tibet.</p>
                <p>Leffler suggested focusing on the specific 10-14 documents as a microcosm of the
                    whole case; he asked if the Committee should write a letter to the Agency.
                    Pereira said he assumed PA/HO would appeal this decision. Herring asked if the
                    documents were still under review. Pereira confirmed that the documents were
                    returned only because of PA/HO’s deadlines. They are still under review because
                    the Historical Review Group is interested in reviewing and releasing the whole
                    case as one of the 11 covert operations.</p>
                <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0067"/>
                <p>Pereira said that PA/HO should identify what is important to have in the volumes;
                    it was State’s responsibility to educate the CIA reviewers about the standards
                    for the volumes. He needs this to give to others in the Agency to explain which
                    documents are needed for the <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes
                    and why. LaFantasie pointed that HO had given the Agency copious material for
                    the Tibet appeal. Pereira once again explained that he needed to educate the
                    officers in the Agency reviewing <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    about the series in general. He wanted a short overview, not long detailed
                    document-by-document analyses.</p>
                <p>Leffler asked if the Committee could meet with reviewers to talk and reach an
                    understanding. McDonald said it might be useful but he wasn’t sure how much it
                    would accomplish. Leffler realized that the prevailing view in the Agency is
                    that the academic community wanted to release material that would embarrass the
                    Agency or reveal dirty tricks. He thought that a meeting might prove that that’s
                    not the case.</p>
                <p>McDonald pointed out that if there were a discussion like that of this morning,
                    you would find yourself faced with real adversaries. Technical issues like
                    agents in the field would impede real discussion of substance. The only place in
                    CIA where you will get a hearing is in the Historical Review Group and the
                    History Staff, but not among senior reviewers or the directorates. The directors
                    can’t believe what’s happening anyway, so Leo Hazlewood was the right person to
                    contact. The CIA is changing with the end of the cold war but very slowly.</p>
                <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0068"/>
                <p>Picker suggested participation from the CIA General Counsel in dealing with legal
                    constraints. McDonald said that he has used the Counsel’s office to convince CIA
                    that the October 1991 statute applies to the CIA. Kimball asked if the Committee
                    should establish contact with the General Counsel.</p>
                <p>McDonald replied that there is a ruling that the statute applies but the General
                    Counsel can’t enforce it. The only “pressure point” is John Pereira -- he is the
                    one working with this issue day-to-day. Pereira said that he can’t get the
                    directors to read the law so he needs a working tool -- a handout -- to spell
                    out the goals and objectives of the <hi rend="underline">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series.</p>
                <p>Leffler asked if Hazlewood was aware of the specific problem of Tibet. Pereira
                    said he was not yet aware of it. Leffler asked if the Committee should send an
                    informal letter to Hazlewood since a formal appeal will take a while. Kimball
                    said the Committee would discuss actions in the executive session in the
                    afternoon.</p>
                <p>Nelson pointed out that during declassification review at Suitland all documents
                    containing the acronym CAS were pulled from the boxes. Does CIA have an informal
                    agreement with NARA about declassification of that particular acronym.</p>
                <p>Van Camp said that State is making a yeoman’s effort to release 30-year old
                    records. Of the 3% withheld, 80% have CIA equity. It would be very helpful if
                    the CIA could assign someone to work with DOS employees to review those
                    documents.</p>
                <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0069"/>
                <p>Pereira agreed and said he was ready to do that now. He has had an exchange of
                    correspondence with Joe Chaddic about this.</p>
                <p>Leffler asked about the CIA provenance problem. LaFantasie said he had talked to
                    Pereira before this session, and Pereira suggested that the three of them
                    (Pereira, LaFantasie, McDonald) talk together and come up with a solution,
                    possibly with NARA input.</p>
                <p>Pereira returned to the issue of CAS, and said that the argument in the Agency is
                    that if the substance is released, how much is lost by deleting CAS. Nelson
                    pointed out that at Suitland the whole document is withdrawn. Pereira said the
                    Agency was trying to avoid denying documents in full. Russell (NARA) said it was
                    very time-consuming to pull documents, and it would be a big help if a CIA
                    reviewer were there.</p>
                <p>Kimball asked if CIA would give State reviewers authority to release a certain
                    acronym. Pereira replied that that was not acceptable now.</p>
                <p>The Committee recessed for lunch.</p>

                    <head><hi rend="underline">Comments from the Historical Office Staff</hi></head>
                    <p>Kimball called the meeting to order at 1:40 p.m. The first agenda item was
                        input from the HO staff. Miller expressed concern that INR plans to review
                        the documents copied by HO historians prior to making them available for use
                        in compiling <hi rend="underline">FRUS</hi> volumes. Schwar stated that it
                        was her understanding that the review was simply to assure that the
                        documents selected by HO historians were relevant to their research.
                        Although HO has not actually received <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0070"
                        /> any documents yet from INR, she thought the situation would work out.
                        Keefer agreed with Schwar’s position. He went on to point out that the INR
                        files, while very good, primarily contain detailed covert operational
                        records. Do we want to print these? Schwar and Miller both responded that,
                        in their view, the INR files included policy papers that lent themselves to
                        printing. Smith pointed out that policy and operational detail were
                        routinely mixed together in such documents. Glad asked whether summaries
                        might substitute for such documents. Schwar responded that it would not be
                        advisable to start with summaries, while Keefer emphasized that HO was in
                        the business of printing documents. Keefer noted, however, that it was
                        likely to be tough sledding getting the INR documents cleared.</p>
                    <p>Keefer raised the issue of the records of the 303 Group, the Special
                        Committee, and the question of whether the series would want to include
                        records with such a great level of detail. Smith indicated that Cuba
                        provided a case study on the Oversight Committee. In covering Operation
                        Mongoose, the series will publish a good deal of material from the Oversight
                        Committee. It was not possible to sort out policy and operational detail at
                        this level. There was some general discussion of this question, and it was
                        agreed that the use of these papers would vary depending on the particular
                        subject. Keefer pointed out that the operations covered by the Special
                        Committee were for the most part operations no one had heard about. Slany
                        said that it would therefore be worth leaving a summary for the records.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0071"/>
                    <p>Gerakas asked, in light of Picker’s subcommittee report the previous day,
                        about the use of the Legal Adviser’s Office files. This comment prompted
                        Kimball to remind the committee that Picker was looking for an additional
                        member or members for her subcommittee and that Van Camp was also interested
                        in expanding the membership of her subcommittee. Picker indicated that the
                        she would be meeting next Friday with Robert Dalton, Assistant Legal Adviser
                        for Treaty Affairs, to discuss this question further.</p>
                    <p>Patterson indicated that he had learned this week for the first time that the
                        Department’s Central Files for 1964-66 were undergoing declassification
                        review. Patterson emphasized that HO historians needed to know which files
                        were under review, which were still at Prince George’s Plaza, which were
                        slated for the National Archives, and were any files removed from PGP and
                        where they are located.</p>
                    <p>Pryor stated that declassified files were housed temporarily in Kenneth
                        Rossman’s office and the still classified material from those files in
                        Chaddic’s office. A conference room is planned for HO historians to review
                        documents when HDR moves to the second floor.</p>
                    <p>Langbart noted that starting in September files that had been reviewed would
                        be transferred to Archives II. Keefer indicated that this might cause a
                        problem for HO researchers. Kimball pointed out that HO had identified a
                        problem here that could be worked out.</p>

                        publication of the series in 1981 with a volume covering the Carter
                        administration. The most recent published volume was that for the year 1990.
                        The Office has discovered that it is stretched thin on resources.
                        Seventy-five percent of the documents in the <hi rend="underline">American
                            Foreign Policy</hi> series were already published in Dispatch, and
                        starting this year another part of PA will publish a CD-ROM publication with
                        comprehensive coverage of Department speeches and statements, plus the daily
                        press briefings, bringing the total of overlapping coverage to 85%. So HO
                        has explored whether it might be better to eliminate <hi rend="underline"
                            >Current Documents</hi> to save financially and well as resources. HO
                        would periodically add documents to the CD-ROM publication thereby providing
                        the usership with everything it would get from a print volume. The CD-ROM
                        publication would go to depository libraries.</p>
                    <p>Kimball asked what sort of time frame the Office needed to receive the
                        Committee’s advice, because the Committee should provide opinion on this
                        question from its constituencies. In response to a question from Picker,
                        Slany indicated that <hi rend="underline">Dispatch</hi> would continue to be
                        published. Glad said she would like to see <hi rend="underline"
                            >Dispatch</hi> to see how good a job it was doing. Kimball proposed to
                        assign action on this question to Betty Glad to determine within the next 6
                        weeks if a veto were necessary. Otherwise the Committee would treat this as
                        an issue of the normal progression of new technology.</p>

                    <p>The discussion then turned to declassification problems regarding
                        documentation proposed for publication in the <hi rend="underline">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series on Japan. Herring, speaking for the subcommittee
                        consisting of Leffler and himself, outlined the three issues under appeal:
                        aspects of implementation of the Security Treaty, related military matters,
                        and the course of Japanese politics. Herring and Leffler were agreeable to
                        publication of the compilation without the material on two of the three
                        issues, but that the third issue on Japanese politics posed a more serious
                        problem. They felt that similiar problems would appear in other <hi
                            rend="underline">FRUS</hi> volumes for the 1960s, so that now was the
                        time to take a stand on the matter.</p>
                    <p>Keefer emphasized that it was Japan at issue here and that Japan was an
                        unusually important country. Leffler responded by noting that HO was having
                        major problems getting material released on Tibet, an unimportant
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Glad stated that at some point the committee may want to recommend against
                        publishing a volume. Slany, Kimball, and Keefer discussed the appeal process
                        and what stage HO had reached in its appeal. Leffler noted that the
                        Historian had recommended as a solution that the volume be published without
                        the documents that had been denied. Kimball indicated that the committee was
                        not inclined to endorse the recommended solution. Glad asked whether the
                        committee shouldn’t use its big gun sometime--recommending against
                        publication. Slany and Keefer outlined the disadvantages of not publishing
                        the compilation. For instance, the Japan desk officer would be perfectly
                        content with such a solution. Nelson emphasized that the impact of
                        withholding publication depends on how it is handled.</p>
                    <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0074"/>
                    <p>Rosenberg suggested linking together the British Guiana and Japan
                        declassification problems. Kimball emphasized the importance of offering
                        Assistant Secretary Moose a reasonable compromise that we can live with
                        rather than two unpleasant alternatives. Pryor noted that State Department
                        documents frequently do not distinguish between discussion of a policy and
                        discussion of operational details since, at the working level, the two are
                        usually inseparable. Thus it is difficult to find discussions of policy
                        which are not also evidence of involvement. She noted that the <hi
                            rend="underline">FRUS</hi> legislation lays down an appeal procedure
                        that had to be followed. Kimball stated that the Historian had already
                        formally appealed. The next step was to go to the Secretary of State (in
                        reality the Under Secretary of State).</p>
                    <p>A general discussion followed of alternate ways of proceeding. Kimball
                        proposed having the subcommittee prepare sanitized documents for review by
                        the desk officer. Kimball than ask what further recommendations the
                        committee should make if the documents were not published as sanitized by
                        the subcommittee. Picker warned that the committee should be careful about
                        having a subcommittee act for the entire committee.</p>
                    <p>LaFantasie stated that he felt uncomfortable about withholding publication
                        and that he also felt uncomfortable about our excising the documents. Slany
                        stated that someone still had to take responsibility. Kimball indicated that
                        he favored specific suggestions for excisions and asked the committee what
                        it recommended. Slany suggested waiting until the next meeting for a
                        decision. The committee agreed to do so. Leffler reasserted the importance
                        of linking the British Guiana and Japan declassification issue.</p>
