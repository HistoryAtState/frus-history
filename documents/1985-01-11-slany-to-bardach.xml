                <p>This Office has carefully considered the contents of your
                    referenced memo and is prepared to agree with the results of the
                    CDC review with the exception of the following two documents
                    listed for denial of declassification on p. 2 of your memo.</p>
                <list>
                    <item>411-412 TAU. Memo of Telcon between JFDulles and Allen
                        Dulles, July 24, 1953.</item>
                    <item>413 TAU. Memo of Telcon between JFDulles and
                        Wisner (CIA), July 25, 1953.</item>
                </list>
                <p>As the attached copies indicate, these two documents were
                    declassified some time ago and were published in 1980 on microfilm
                    by University Publications of America. They have also been available
                    to the general public for research at the Eisenhower Library
                    for a like period of time. In view of this, I ask for restoration
                    of the full text of both documents to the volume.</p>
                <p>I understand that your response will constitute agreement
                    between our two offices on Department of State clearance and that
                    we await other agency clearances including NSC.</p>
