                <p>Subject: <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>, Volume X,
                    Iran, 1951-1954; Final Clearance for Publication</p>
                <p>After some nine years, including delays occasioned by events in the Middle East,
                    CDC has completed its review of the documents proposed by the Historical Office
                    for publication in a volume of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</hi> covering U.S. relations with Iran during 1951-1954. In addition
                    to review within the Department of State and CIA, documents of interest to the
                    Department of Defense, the Export-Import Bank, and the IBRD have been reviewed
                    by those organizations. Finally, numerous documents of interest to the United
                    Kingdom have been reviewed by the British Foreign Office.</p>
                <p>The history of this volume is particularly complex. The section covering 1951 was
                    originally reviewed and cleared before the Iranian Revolution. Although already
                    put into page proof form by HO, action was suspended and the volume was
                    re-reviewed in 1983. Meanwhile, documents covering 1952-1954 had been assembled
                    and reviewed as part of a larger Near East volume from which it was later
                    separated. The years 1951 to 1954 were consolidated into a single volume in 1984
                    and, in large part, re-reviewed. At different times all parts of the volume have
                    been cleared in NEA contingent upon subsequent clearance by NSC. Now, with NSC
                    clearance the volume is ready for final clearance to publication.</p>
                <p>The criteria applied in reviewing this volume are those set out in <ref

                    Mr. Constable’s memorandum, with Mr. Charles Naas of CDC/MR and most of the
