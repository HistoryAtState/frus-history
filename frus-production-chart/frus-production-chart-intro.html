    <p>This chart illustrates annualized data for the production and timeliness of the <em>Foreign
            Relations</em> series. While the chart reflects the entire history of the series, you
        can use the dynamic range selector to focus upon a more specific period.</p>
    <p>“Annual <em>FRUS</em> Production,” displayed in red, reports the number of volumes released
        during each calendar year. Both of the “Lag” datasets, displayed in blue, report three
        values: the solid line illustrates the <em>average</em> lag for all the volumes published in
        a given year and the shaded region above and below this line (if present) shows the range of
        the <em>lowest</em> and <em>highest</em> lags for volumes produced that year. The lag for a
        volume is the number of years elapsed between the creation of the <em>latest</em> document
        that it contains and the publication of the volume. Beginning in the 1930s, many special
        retrospective and supplemental volumes, designed to address lacunae in earlier volumes’
        coverage of significant documentation, have been produced as part of the <em>Foreign
            Relations</em> series. Conversely, since the 1940s, special accelerated volumes on
        selected topics have also been published. Both types of these “special” volumes manifest
        different production challenges than those involved with “regular” volumes and, to
        facilitate more precise tracking of the evolving lag of “regular” volumes, they have been
        excluded from the “Average Regular <em>FRUS</em> Lag” dataset.</p>
